I really got no idea whats going on with this but just wanted somewhere to play around with vue and electron together  
## Project setup
In order to install electron node modules
```
npm install electron
```
It'll probably have a ton of errors dunno

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development (in electron)
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
