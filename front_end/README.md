# Front End
Basically only set up Electron and Vue, no content has been started (Oct15).  
Anyone wishing to view/work with the front end must install the node modules (listed below) in the front_end directory locally.  
## Project setup
In order to install electron node modules
```
npm install --save-dev electron@latest
```
In order to install Vue2
```
npm install --save vue
```
**It'll probably have a some errors**

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development (in electron)
```
npm run start
```
