**We'll have to verify DB2 is actually accessible via electron before we get too far into frontend**  

To install electron node modules for your system, run ```npm install --save-dev electron``` in the *frontend* directory.  
To launch the current electron app, use ```npm start``` from the *frontend* directory.  
Main electron app (*main.js*) file is in root of js folder, and main html file (*index.html*) is in root of html folder.

**Currently using bootstrap, but will likely switch to react, angular or vue i imagine**  
Bootstrap css/js files are local to repo in their respective css/js folders.  
- Can likely delete most of the bootstrap files for final version since we probably won't use the majority of them, they're all downloaded for now though
