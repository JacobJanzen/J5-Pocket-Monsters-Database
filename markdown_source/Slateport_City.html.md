'''Slateport City''' (Japanese: '''{{j|カイナシティ}}''' ''Kaina City'') is a port town on the southern coast of [[Hoenn]]. It is the ninth largest city in the [[Pokémon world]].

Slateport was created because the clean water made the food abundant in the area, so a local market started to grow. The city then soon became a harbor where ships and boats come and go. There is a lighthouse near the south of Slateport that illuminates the sea for passing ships. It is a great shopping destination with a local Slateport Market. [[Captain Stern]] is a big name in Slateport. He is an undersea explorer who runs [[Stern's Shipyard]], the local [[Oceanic Museum]] and also working on the [[S.S. Tidal]] which runs in and out of Slateport City after its completion.

The city has three major entrances, one from the north of Slateport City is {{rt|110|Hoenn}}, which has a bicycle route as well as a path to [[Mauville City]], one that is directly south of the city is the beach of {{rt|109|Hoenn}}, and one that is east of the city is the ocean path of {{rt|134|Hoenn}}, but the water's current is too strong to {{m|Surf}} east.

==Slogan==
'''The port where people and Pokémon cross paths with nature.''' (Japanese: '''ヒトと　ポケモンが　いきかう　みなと''' ''The port where people and Pokémon cross paths with nature.'')

==Places of interest==
===Slateport Market===
''"Unique items found nowhere else!"''

The Slateport Market is an open-air bazaar featuring items that cannot be easily found anywhere else. The Slateport Market has been in business since the creation of Slateport City itself as the clean water made the food abundant in the area, so a local market started to grow. The Slateport Market is situated next to the ocean, so the scent of the salty sea seeps through the air. There is a place to buy [[Secret Base]] {{cat|decorations}}, [[vitamin]]s, [[Incense]]s{{sup/6|ORAS}}, and fresh seaweed there.

=====Berry Powder woman=====
In Pokémon Emerald, there is a woman in the northern part of the market who concocts a variety of medicines from [[Berry Powder]] and will exchange Berry Powder for [[herbal medicine]] and [[vitamin]]s. When she is first visited, he gives the player the [[Powder Jar]], and will ask the player to make some Berry Powder from the new machine that crushes Berries in the [[Pokémon Center]] upstairs. There is also a sign next to her that keeps a record of pressing-speed ranking the player achieves.

===Oceanic Museum===
{{main|Oceanic Museum}}
The Oceanic Museum is a large two-floored museum located in the eastern district of Slateport. The museum was built by [[Captain Stern]] to teach others of the ocean and the ocean floor. There is a {{PDollar}}50 entrance fee which must be paid upon entry. The first floor contains information about the sea. There are seven exhibits, each with a different piece of information about the sea. On the western wing, there are experiments and displays involving {{m|Whirlpool}}s, {{m|Waterfall}}s, buoyancy, and fossilization. While, on the eastern wing, there are displays and samples of ancient beach sand, and old sedimentary rocks, as well as fun facts about the sea. On the second floor, there are nine more exhibits, which include models of the [[Hoenn]] region and the ship [[S.S. Anne]]. The museum can be entered free of charge before Team Magma or Team Aqua leave, as the reception believes that the player is part of their group. However, this only works if the player lacks the money needed for the {{PDollar}}50 fee.

===Pokémon Fan Club===
{{main|Pokémon Fan Club}}
Slateport is the home to the headquarters for the [[Hoenn]] branch of the Pokémon Fan Club. The Fan Club is basically a place for people to meet and chat about their favorite Pokémon and to show off their collections to each other. In general, the members are usually more oriented to unevolved, cute Pokémon and [[Pokémon Contest]]s than [[Pokémon battle]]s. The people in the Fan Club adore their Pokémon and give friendly advice. One of the women in the Fan Club will give away a [[Soothe Bell]] if the player's Pokémon has a high [[friendship]]. In {{v2|Emerald}}, people show off their Pokémon in Contests because the [[Contest Hall]] in [[Lilycove City]] is too far to travel. [[Gabby and Ty]] often visit the Club House in Hoenn to do interviews with enthusiastic Trainers.

Trainers of the {{tc|Poké Fan}} {{DL|Pokémon Trainer|Trainer class}} are members of the Pokémon Fan Club. The Hoenn [[Pokémon Fan Club Chairman]] sits in the center of the club house. He claims to have raised over 100 different Pokémon in his lifetime. He travels across the nation on his {{p|Fearow}}.

In {{game|Emerald}}, there is a [[Move Tutor]] here who will teach a compatible Pokémon {{m|Swagger}} one time only. In {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, a {{tc|Pokémon Breeder}} here can trim {{p|Furfrou}} for {{pdollar}}500.

===Stern's Shipyard===
{{main|Stern's Shipyard}}
Stern's Shipyard is a building owned by [[Captain Stern]]. Stern's Shipyard is a large brown building located next to the ocean. In front of the building are two houses, and around the building are three small wooden boats. It is located in the eastern part of Slateport City, and is where the [[S.S. Tidal]] was constructed. The Shipyard also takes old boats and sinks them, to make [[List of Pokémon by habitat|habitats]] for the Pokémon who live around the city and its neighboring beaches.

===Slateport Harbor===
The Harbor is located at the northeast of Slateport. This is where [[Captain Stern]] can be found most of the time, trading the [[Scanner]] for a [[Deep Sea Scale|DeepSeaScale]] or [[Deep Sea Tooth|DeepSeaTooth]]. After the player visits the summit of [[Mt. Pyre]] for the first time (and, in Emerald, also clears the [[Team Magma Hideout|Magma Hideout]]), Captain Stern is seen being interviewed outside the Harbor. [[Submarine Explorer 1]] is then stolen by [[Team Aqua]]{{sup/3|Sa}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}}/[[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|Ru}}{{sup/6|OR}}. After entering the [[Hall of Fame]], Captain Stern is here, asking the player to go on a cruise on the [[S.S. Tidal]].

====Vending Machine====
In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], there is a [[Vending Machine]] at the back of the harbor building.

===Name Rater===
{{main|Name Rater}}
The Name Rater of Hoenn lives in northern district of Slateport City. As always, he allows Trainers to change the nickname of any Pokémon they captured or received in-game. Those traded from outside sources will not be able to be renamed. If the Pokémon was caught by the player that currently owns it, he'll say that the name could be better and offer the player the option of changing it. If the Pokémon he's judging was obtained via a trade, he will say that the name is perfect and refuse to change it. However, if both players have identical [[Trainer ID number|Trainer IDs and secret IDs]], he will allow name changes.

===Contest Hall===
{{main|Contest Hall}}
The [[Rank (Contest)|Hyper Rank]] [[Pokémon Contest]] is located in Slateport. Only Pokémon who have beaten the [[Rank (Contest)|Super Rank]] can perform here. It is replaced by the [[Battle Tent]] in {{v2|Emerald}}. Contest entries of all ranks are unrestricted in {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}.

===Battle Tent===
{{main|Battle Tent#Slateport Battle Tent: Battle Factory|Battle Tent}}
The Battle Tent can only be found in {{game|Emerald}}. It is one of the three Battle Tents found in Emerald. Entrants pick out three Pokémon from a list of 6 random rentals, all at level 30. Then, three Trainers battle, having a chance after each battle to possibly trade a Pokémon for one from the person that was just defeated.

==Demographics==
===Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire===
In {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, the population of Slateport City is 76, making it the second largest city in [[Hoenn]], behind [[Lilycove City]]. Slateport City's high population can be attributed to a number of factors, such as its market, beach, and shipyard.

===Pokémon Emerald===
In {{game|Emerald}}, the population of Slateport City is 60, making it the third largest city in Hoenn after the cities of {{ci|Lilycove}} and {{ci|Rustboro}}.

===Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire===
In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Slateport City has a total population of 79, making it the third largest city in Hoenn after the cities of {{ci|Mauville}} and {{ci|Lilycove}}.

==In the anime==
[[File:Slateport City anime.png|thumb|250px|Slateport City in the anime]]
In the {{pkmn|anime}}, Slateport City is a large city on a cliff overlooking the ocean. It is also the [[hometown]] of [[Harley]], a [[Pokémon Coordinator]] and one of {{an|May}}'s [[rival]]s. {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrived there in ''[[AG033|Now That's Flower Power!]]'', where May met [[Drew]] while {{pkmn|training|practicing}} for the Slateport City [[Pokémon Contest]] with her {{TP|May|Beautifly}} at the beach.

In ''[[AG034|Having a Wailord of a Time]]'', it was revealed that Slateport City's [[Nurse Joy]], in addition to being responsible for the health and well-being of Pokémon at the [[Pokémon Center]], gives new {{pkmn|Trainer}}s their [[starter Pokémon]]. Joy explained that [[Littleroot Town]]'s location may be difficult for some Trainers to reach, and Slateport City offers a convenient alternative. New Trainers have the choice of {{p|Treecko}}, {{p|Torchic}}, and {{p|Mudkip}}.

The Slateport Contest took place in ''[[AG035|Win, Lose or Drew!]]''. May was very nervous as it was her first time competing in a Pokémon Contest, while contestants such as Drew and {{ho|Robert}} were more relaxed. In the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]], Drew did a very good job at showcasing his {{TP|Drew|Roselia}}'s style and skill, earning a high score from the [[Contest Judge|panel of judges]]. Robert also managed to  captivate the judges' attention with his {{p|Milotic}}, delivering a performance that received a perfect score.

Later, when May was called on stage, her nervousness got the best of her and she fell down to the ground when she was about to call out her Beautifly. [[Vivian Meridian|Vivian]] helped her to get up and May kicked things off by throwing a {{wp|flying disc}} up in the air so Beautifly could use {{m|String Shot}} on it and send it back to her. After that, Beautifly created a giant tornado with its {{m|Silver Wind}} attack. Despite May's shaky start, the judges felt her performance was impressive enough and she was among the Coordinators moving on to the [[Contest Battle]]s along with Drew and Robert.

After the list of contestants was randomly shuffled, the match-ups for the second round were determined, revealing that May would face off against Drew in the first match. May was determined to beat her rival, but her lack of experience caused her downfall as Beautifly was subdued by Roselia's powerful {{m|Solar Beam}}. With Beautifly unable to continue battling, the judges ruled {{DL|Fainting|Battle Off}} and declared Drew as the winner. Afterwards, Drew and his Roselia went up against Robert and his Milotic in the semifinals. Despite Drew's efforts, Robert easily defeated him and proceeded to the finals, where he once again emerged victorious, earning the coveted Slateport [[Ribbon]].

In ''[[AG036|The Spheal of Approval]]'', Ash and Max visited the [[Oceanic Museum]] and met [[Captain Stern]], but they were caught in an attack by [[Team Magma]]. The thief got away with only half of the volcanic stone, while Captain Stern was able to recover the other half to continue his research.

After learning that the [[Hoenn Grand Festival]] would be held in Slateport City, May and her friends traveled there aboard the [[S.S. St. Flower]] in ''[[AG119|The Ribbon Cup Caper]]''. The event took place from ''[[AG121|Hi Ho Silver Wind!]]'' to ''[[AG123|Rhapsody in Drew]]''. May, Drew, Harley, Robert, and {{OBP|Anthony|AG122}} were ultimately among the 247 Coordinators who qualified for the competition. During the competition, May was able to defeat Harley and Anthony, but lost to Drew in the quarterfinal round. In the end, Robert emerged victorious by defeating Drew, earning the [[Ribbon Cup]] and becoming a [[Top Coordinator]].

In ''[[JN031|The Cuteness Quotient!]]'', Ash, [[Goh]], [[Chloe]], and [[Jinny]] visited Slateport City so that Jinny could compete in the [[Friendship Festival]] with her {{p|Feebas}}. While in Slateport, Goh caught a {{DL|List of Goh's Pokémon|Wingull}}.

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PS200|Tripped Up by Torkoal]]'', {{adv|Ruby}} and {{adv|Sapphire}} arrived at Slateport on Sapphire's {{p|Wailord}}, [[nickname]]d Lorry. After splitting up from Sapphire, Ruby met the region's [[Pokémon Fan Club Chairman]], who led Ruby to the city's [[Contest Hall]]. There, Ruby learned that he had to apply for a new [[Contest Pass]] in [[Verdanturf Town]]. After witnessing [[Team Magma]] attacking [[Stern's Shipyard]], Ruby ended up escaping them into [[Submarine Explorer 1]], which subsequently dived on autopilot, with him and {{tc|Magma Admin}} [[Blaise]] on board.

After [[Maxie]] awakened {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}} and {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}} at [[Seafloor Cavern]], Slateport City was struck by a tsunami. In ''[[PS232|Always Keep Whiscash on You for Emergencies]]'', Ruby returned to the flooded city to compete in the {{OBP|Rank|Contest|Hyper Rank}} [[Pokémon Contest]]s, despite being the only competitor. However, he failed to obtain the Hyper Rank {{OBP|Beautiful|condition|Beauty}} [[Ribbon]] due to his {{p|Feebas}}, [[Feefee]], being outperformed by a [[Wallace|mystery competitor]]. Angered by this, Ruby vented his frustration out on Feefee, who swam away and appeared to get trapped by the collapsing Contest Hall. After being taken to a nearby hospital unconscious, Ruby decided to help the Hoenn [[Gym Leader]]s and Sapphire deal with the crisis.

===={{chap|Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PAORAS00|Omega Alpha Adventure 0]]'', Sapphire learned from {{adv|Emerald}} that while the two were out training in {{to|Dewford}}, Ruby was at Slateport hosting a Contest Spectacular with [[Lisia]]. After being interviewed by [[Gabby and Ty|Gabby]], Ruby departed to [[Southern Island]] to meet up with {{adv|Eon duo|Latios and Latias}}. In ''[[PAORAS21|Omega Alpha Adventure 21]]'', Ruby and Sapphire performed together in a Contest Spectacular at the Slateport City Contest Hall.

==Trivia==
* As Hoenn coincides with {{wp|Kyushu}}, Slateport coincides with {{wp|Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki}}'s location.
