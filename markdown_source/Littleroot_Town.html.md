'''Littleroot Town''' (Japanese: '''{{j|ミシロタウン}}''' ''Mishiro Town'') is located in southwestern [[Hoenn]]. It is where {{player}}s of the Hoenn-based games start their [[Pokémon journey]]s. Hoenn's region-exclusive professor, [[Professor Birch]], has a laboratory in the town that he uses for research on Pokémon.

The only exit of the town is north, which leads to {{rt|101|Hoenn}} and [[Oldale Town]] beyond. A person will block off this exit until the player has met {{ga|Brendan}}/{{ga|May}} in the house opposite the player's own.

==Slogan==
'''''A town that can't be shaded any hue.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|どんな　いろにも　そまらない　まち}}''' ''A town that can't be shaded any hue.'')

==Places of interest==
===Professor Birch's Lab===
In the southwest corner of town is [[Professor Birch]]'s Laboratory. Here, Pokémon Trainers just beginning their quest can receive either a {{p|Treecko}}, {{p|Torchic}}, or {{p|Mudkip}} from Professor Birch. Instead of obtaining the player's [[starter Pokémon]] here, the player must gain it on {{rt|101|Hoenn}} while saving Professor Birch during the storyline. [[Joshua (assistant)|Professor Birch's assistant]] often looks after the laboratory by himself because Professor Birch likes doing field work instead of being inside his laboratory. Professor Birch's house is also located in the northeast (if player character is male) or northwest (if player character is female). In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the player can use the cardboard boxes in Birch's lab to change {{p|Rotom}}'s [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Rotom|form]].

===Player's house===
{{main|Player's house#Hoenn|Player's house → Hoenn}}
[[File:Player Bedroom RS.png|thumb|Inside the player's bedroom]]
This is the house where the player lives before beginning their journey. The game begins with the player moving into Littleroot from the [[Johto]] region. The male character lives in the house on the left, while the female character lives in the house on the right. The player's {{ho|Mom}} lives here, while [[Norman]], the player's father, drops by and stays a while. After the {{player}} obtains their starter Pokémon on Route 101, going home and talking to their mother will fully restore all of the player's Pokémon, just like a [[Pokémon Center]].

There are two levels, the first being a living room and kitchen area, while upstairs on the second level is where the player's bedroom is located. In [[Generation III]], it contains a clock that the player must set at the start of the game to keep track of the [[time]], a [[Nintendo GameCube]] with a [[Game Boy Advance]] hooked up to it as a controller, and a [[PC]] to store [[item]]s and {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. A [[Potion]] is stored in the PC and can be withdrawn as soon as the player first uses it. The rug can be decorated with {{pkmn|doll|Poké Dolls}}. In [[Generation VI]], the clock is set to the correct time automatically by interacting with it, the GameCube has been replaced by a [[Wii U]] with a GamePad, there is no PC, and no dolls can be placed into the room.

The [[Television|TV]] found here is the only one in [[Hoenn]] to detail the current broadcast, specifically a movie on TV wherein two men are dancing on a big piano keyboard.

===Rival's house===
{{ga|Brendan}} lives in the house on the left, while {{ga|May}} lives in the house on the right. The rival's house is similar to the {{player}}'s house. As the rival is the son/daughter of Prof. Birch, it is also his residence.

==Role==
===Delta Episode===
During the [[Delta Episode]], immediately after the player resumes the game after entering the [[Hall of Fame]] for the first time, the player's parents are talking about their upcoming plans. Despite already buying a [[Pair of Tickets]] to see a star show in [[Mossdeep City]], [[Norman]] has to be at the [[Petalburg Gym]] that day, so he is unable to go. When the player goes downstairs, Norman gives the player the Pair of Tickets, and suggests they invite their neighbor {{ga|Brendan}}/{{ga|May}} to go with them.

Upon stepping outside, [[Zinnia]] meets the player for the first time and briefly introduces herself.

Upon entering {{ga|Brendan}}/{{ga|May}}'s house, the player's neighbor exclaims that Zinnia has stolen their Key Stone; despite their attempt to battle her, Zinnia's Pokémon were too strong. The player's neighbor then mentions that Zinnia has said "{{ci|Petalburg}}'s next".

==In the anime==
[[File:Littleroot Town anime.png|thumb|250px|Littleroot Town in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
In the leadup to the [[Silver Conference]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} met {{jo|Harrison}}, who mentioned that he was from Littleroot Town, in ''[[EP265|Pop Goes the Sneasel]]''.

Littleroot Town first appeared at the very end of ''[[EP274|Hoenn Alone]]''. Upon arrival into Littleroot Town's port, [[Jessie]] indicated that she had been to the town sometime before and referred to it as "the city whose colors will never change", though she didn't elaborate further.

In ''[[AG001|Get the Show on the Road!]]'', Ash met [[Professor Birch]] and {{an|May}} here for the first time while trying to save his {{AP|Pikachu}} from an electrical overcharge it had received during a recent encounter with {{TRT}}. Ironically, Team Rocket also ended up accidentally curing Pikachu while trying to capture him with their electricity-absorbing [[Team Rocket's mechas|mecha]]. May had traveled from her home in [[Petalburg City]] to Littleroot to choose a [[starter Pokémon]] from Professor Birch. She eventually chose {{TP|May|Torchic}}.

Littleroot Town's port was seen again in ''[[AG071|A Six Pack Attack!]]''. At the end of the episode, Ash and {{ashfr}} boarded a boat from the port towards [[Fortree City]].

Ash and {{an|Brock}} used the port to leave [[Hoenn]] for [[Kanto]] in ''[[AG132|The Scheme Team]]''.

In ''[[JN022|Goodbye, Friend!]]'', Ash and [[Goh]] traveled to Littleroot Town to document the migratory patterns of the {{p|Beautifly}} in the area.

In the anime, Littleroot Town is a waterfront location, complete with a port, and is shown as quite a large town with mainly tall buildings and towers. In ''[[Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire]]'', it didn't have a [[Pokémon Center]], but one was later revealed to have been built there in ''[[Pokémon Journeys: The Series]]''.

Professor Birch's laboratory is located in the forested outskirts of Littleroot Town. The site consists of a main arch-shaped building and two smaller, separate structures on either side. The separate structure on the right includes a spare room where Ash watched Pikachu recover overnight.

===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
{{adv|Ruby}} and his family moved from [[Johto]] to Littleroot Town in ''[[PS181|Creeping Past Cacnea]]'', although Ruby ran away from home [[PS182|as soon as the moving had been completed]], intending to win every {{pkmn|Contest}} in the Hoenn region as a protest to [[Norman|his father]]'s demands to have him do {{pkmn|battle}} training instead of Contests.

Like the rest of southern Hoenn, Littleroot Town was flooded following {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}}'s awakening in ''[[PS235|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon III]]''.

===Pokémon Ruby-Sapphire===
Littleroot Town appeared in ''[[PMRS02|I Won't Let You Lead!!]]''. {{PPM|Red}} and his Pokémon challenged Professor Birch to various contests at a fishing hole located there, and lost them all.

==Trivia==
* As Hoenn coincides with {{wp|Kyushu}}, the location of Littleroot coincides with the city of {{wp|Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo}}.
* The movie playing in the player's house is most likely ''{{wp|Big (film)|Big}}'', as it has a famous scene where the main character (played by {{wp|Tom Hanks}}) dances on a giant piano keyboard with his boss (played by {{wp|Robert Loggia}}).
