The '''Island Cave''' (Japanese: '''{{tt|小島の横穴|こじまのよこあな}}''' ''Islet Cave'') is a location in [[Hoenn]] on a small island on {{rt|105|Hoenn}}. {{p|Regice}} resides in the innermost chamber.

==Encounter with Regice==
To get to Regice, the [[Sealed Chamber]]'s puzzle must be completed. After this has happened, the ruins can be accessed.

To open the door in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, once in the lobby area, the {{player}} must read the Braille inside and simply stand in the same place for two minutes without touching the game. The door will still open even if the game's internal battery has run dry and clock-based events no longer occur, as it is based on two minutes of recorded playtime. The [[Braille]] reads: "&lt;sc>Stop and wait. Wait for time to pass twice.&lt;/sc>"

To open the door in {{game|Emerald}}, once in the lobby area, the player must read the Braille inside, then make a lap of the chamber, sticking close to the walls. The Braille reads: "&lt;sc>Stay close to the wall. Run around one lap.&lt;/sc>"

To open the door in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, once in the lobby area, the player must read the Braille inside and stand in the same place for two minutes without moving. The Braille reads: "&lt;sc>Stop and wait unmoving as time passes you by twice.&lt;/sc>"

==Encounter with Regigigas==
In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the player is able to encounter {{p|Regigigas}} in the Island Cave after capturing all three [[Legendary titans]] in their respective locations in that game. To do so, the player must go to [[Pacifidlog Town]] and speak to the girl in the northeast house. The player must also have a [[nickname]]d Regice holding an ice-based item (a [[Casteliacone]], a [[Never-Melt Ice]], an [[Icy Rock]], or a [[Snowball]]), as well as {{p|Regirock}} and {{p|Registeel}} in their [[party]]. Regigigas can be encountered starting from the day after catching the last of the Legendary titans, but cannot be encountered at [[Time|night]]. As Regigigas is not in the Hoenn Pokédex, it can only be battled after capturing/defeating {{p|Groudon}}{{sup/6|OR}}/{{p|Kyogre}}{{sup/6|AS}}.

If all of the above criteria are fulfilled, upon walking into the center of Regice's room, the following message will appear:
:''"The very earth is quaking! Is something approaching?!"''
:''"Zut zutt!"''

The battle with Regigigas will then start immediately.

If the above criteria are not fulfilled, but the player has caught all of the Legendary titans in that same game, the following message will appear instead:
:''"...?"''
:''"There seemed to be some presence here, but it disappeared in an instant..."''

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PS251|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon XIII]]'', [[Glacia]] was stationed at the Island Cave as a part of {{Steven}}'s plan to unseal the {{TP|Brandon|Legendary titans}}. Despite Glacia's best efforts to open it, the seal wasn't undone until ''[[PS254|A Royal Rumble with Regirock, Regice and Registeel II]]'', where Steven figured out the key to unlocking it.
