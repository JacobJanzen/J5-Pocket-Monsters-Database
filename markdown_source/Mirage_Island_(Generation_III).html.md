'''Mirage Island''' (Japanese: '''まぼろしじま''' ''Phantom Island'') is a hard-to-reach location in [[Hoenn]], found on {{rt|130|Hoenn}} in {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}. It can only be visited under highly rare circumstances.

==In the games==
The island is inhabited by {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Wynaut}}, which range from [[level]] 5 to level 50. Most notably, the island also bears a tree where the one and only [[Liechi Berry]] in the game can be picked. This is the best Berry for [[Pokéblock]]s, and will produce Gold Pokéblocks. It can also be used as a [[held item]] in {{pkmn|battle}}s, where it will increase a Pokémon's {{stat|Attack}} in a pinch.

Every day, a random number between 0 and 65535 is generated by the game. If this number matches the first two bytes of the [[personality value]] of any {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in the {{player}}'s party, then Mirage Island will appear. (Consequently, Mirage Island can be made to disappear and reappear for that day by removing and putting back the matching Pokémon in the party, and Mirage Island will disappear at the end of the day barring the unlikely outcome of two matching numbers being generated in a row.) This makes Mirage Island's appearance even rarer than encountering a [[Shiny Pokémon]], although the probability increases with the number of Pokémon the player has. The odds of a single Pokémon activating Mirage Island is 1/65536; this chance is increased to approximately 1/10923 if the player has a full party, assuming no two Pokémon in the player's party have the same first two bytes in their personality values.

An old man in the southeastern hut in [[Pacifidlog Town]] will tell the player whether or not he can see Mirage Island, allowing the player to check if they have a matching Pokémon without having to leave the town. Since Mirage Island's number does not change throughout a given day, it is possible for the {{player}} to freely move Pokémon between the [[Pokémon Storage System|boxes]] and the [[party]] while attempting to check if any Pokémon in the party matches the Mirage Island number.

===Technical details===
[[Save data structure (Generation III)#Section 2 - Environment variables|Two random bytes]] ("Mirage Island bytes") are generated for the day once any button is pressed on the start menu, and will last until the start menu is accessed again past 00:00 (midnight) of the next day. Even though play time has nothing to do with [[time|the real-time clock]], a game that has reached the maximum time of play (999 hours and 59 minutes) will always generate Mirage Island bytes of 0. Additionally, if a game's internal battery is dead (causing the real-time clock to stop functioning), then new Mirage Island bytes will never be generated, causing the Mirage Island number to permanently stay at whatever value it was before.&lt;ref>http://hfc2x.tumblr.com/post/52327921622/some-explanation-on-mirage-island-pok%C3%A9mon&lt;/ref> Due to these mechanics, Mirage Island activation can by gamed by [[Pseudorandom number generation in Pokémon|abusing RNG]]. Currently, it has not been precisely documented what happens to a game which has both a dead internal battery and a maximized play time&lt;!-- we aren't even sure if order matters or not -->.

==In the anime==
[[File:Mirage Island anime.png|thumb|250px|Mirage Island in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
In ''[[AG113|Who, What, When, Where, Wynaut?]]'', {{Ash}}, {{ashfr}}, [[Drew]], and {{TRT}} landed on Mirage Island after [[Team Rocket's mechas|Team Rocket's submarine]] crashed. {{an|May}} and Drew got separated from the others and ended up nearly drowning when Drew passed out, before being saved by the resident {{p|Wynaut}} population. Team Rocket tried to steal the island's rare [[Liechi Berry|Liechi Berries]], but were ultimately stopped. The group was eventually shipped off the island by a man named [[Roderick]], who also gave May some Liechi Berries to be used as [[Pokéblock]] ingredients.

While the island does appear on maps, the whirlpools around it make it almost impossible to get to or off the island.

===Pokémon Adventures===
According to [[Juan]], Mirage Island is not the actual name of the island, but what people refer to it as.

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PS240|Talk About Timing, Treecko]]'', {{adv|Wally}} rescued a man searching for Mirage Island in [[Pacifidlog Town]] from being washed away by {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}}'s storm.

In ''[[PS254|A Royal Rumble with Regirock, Regice and Registeel II]]'', {{adv|Ruby}} and {{adv|Sapphire}} were washed up on Mirage Island, where they met Juan, [[Tate and Liza|Tate, and Liza]]. Juan explained that the time on the island advances at a different pace than in the outside world, resulting in the two having been unconcious for 21 days. The time on the island does not always travel at a constant speed, and when the time on the island goes normal, one can get on or off the island. While staying on the island, Ruby and Sapphire encountered the {{TP|Ruby|Plusle}} and {{TP|Sapphire|Minun}} from the [[Abandoned Ship]] again and trained to become better at [[Double Battle]]s, in order to be ready to face Kyogre and {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}}. After their training was complete, the [[Gym Leader]]s awarded Sapphire with the {{badge|Mind|Mind}} and {{badge|Rain}}s, before the two [[Pokédex holder]]s left the island in ''[[PS259|Rayquaza Redemption II]]''.

While Ruby and Sapphire fought against Kyogre and Groudon, and subsequently [[Archie]] and [[Maxie]], Juan, Tate, and Liza observed the events from Mirage Island through Juan's {{p|Kingdra}}'s water screen. In ''[[PS267|It All Ends Now VIII]]'', when Ruby was revealed to be in possession of {{adv|Celebi}}, Juan realized that Celebi's presence on the island explained why time had become unstable there when Ruby and Sapphire arrived on and left it.

==Trivia==
* Although {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}} include a [[List of locations by index number (Generation III)|location pointer for "Mirage Island"]], any {{p|Wynaut}} caught here will simply display "Met on {{rt|130|Hoenn}}" in their [[summary]]. This is because the player is technically still on Route 130's map.
* Although Mirage Island does not appear in {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the route description of Route 130 on the [[PokéNav Plus]] [[List of cross-generational references|alludes]] to it; "This route was once a big topic of conversation due to a strange island that seemed to appear and then disappear."
* If a [[roaming Pokémon]] goes onto Route 130 while the Mirage Island is present, it can also be found in the tall grass.
