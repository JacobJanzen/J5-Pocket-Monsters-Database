The '''Cove Lily Motel''' (Japanese: '''{{tt|民宿|みんしゅく}}モナミ''' ''Monami Boarding House'') is a [[Hoenn]] location found in [[Lilycove City]]. A sign outside the building reads:
{{sign|E|header}}
{{sign|E|title|Cove Lily Motel}}
{{sign|E|"Remember us as 'Cove Lily' of Lilycove."}}
{{sign|E|footer}}

Due to the fact that [[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|R}} or [[Team Aqua]]{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/3|E}} are situated in [[Lilycove City]], the city has become an unpopular tourist destination, so the Cove Lily Motel has become empty. However, once the Team is scared away by the player, the [[Game Freak]] staff will come to the second floor after the player has entered the [[Hall of Fame]].

==Floors==
===First floor===
The motel has a very simple layout. The lower level only contains a man watching a TV set. If the player attempts to check the TV, they will be shoved away by the man for blocking his view.

In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, there is a kitchen at the top-right corner of the room, though the man prevents the player from entering. If the player uses the [[Devon Scope]] on the invisible object in front of the man, it will reveal a {{p|Kecleon}}. The man will notice it and connect it to the food that would mysteriously disappear from the kitchen; he then allows Kecleon to serve as the motel's mascot.

===Second floor===
The upper level is deserted until the player has entered the [[Hall of Fame]]; however, in Emerald, [[Scott]] will be napping at a table. Once the player has entered the Hall of Fame, the upper level contains the [[Game Freak]] staff, as it is where they are staying while in Hoenn. Players will find the Graphic Artist, the Programmer, and the Game Designer.

In Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, the Game Designer will give the player the Poké [[Diploma]] after completing the [[National Pokédex]].

In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the floor is split into two rooms, the upper room containing a programmer, a game planner, an unnamed staff member of Game Freak and the Game Director. The Game Director walks around the central table and will give the player the Regional Award for completing the [[List of Pokémon by Hoenn Pokédex number (Generation VI)|Hoenn Pokédex]] and the National Award for completing the National Pokédex. He will also give the Time Travel Award if the player shows him a Pokémon caught in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald in the lead slot of their party before talking to him. All three Diplomas can be displayed in a player's [[Secret Base]] as [[Poster|wall decorations]]. The lower room contains a graphic designer with a {{p|Poochyena}} and another, unnamed staff member of Game Freak.

In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, a [[Vending Machine]] is located directly next to the stairs.

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
The Cove Lily Motel, known in the [[Chuang Yi]] translation as the Lilycove Inn, was the site of [[Roxanne]] and [[Courtney]]'s battle during the weather crisis, first appearing in ''[[PS245|Bravo, Vibrava]]''. Using her {{TP|Roxanne|Nosepass}}'s {{m|Block}}, Roxanne was able to temporarily halt {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}}'s advancement through [[Hoenn]]. However, in ''[[PS248|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon X]]'', Courtney threatened the lives of the programmer, graphic artist, and game designer residing at the motel, forcing Roxanne to surrender and let Nosepass be defeated, allowing Groudon to continue moving on. Having achieved her objective, Courtney subsequently left in ''[[PS250|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon XII]]''.
