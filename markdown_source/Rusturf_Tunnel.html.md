'''Rusturf Tunnel''' (Japanese: '''カナシダトンネル''' ''Kanashida Tunnel'') is a tunnel between [[Rustboro City]] and [[Verdanturf Town]], hence the name. Due to construction on the tunnel, Verdanturf Town can't be accessed through Rusturf Tunnel during the first stages of the game. {{m|Rock Smash}} is needed to fully travel across the Rusturf Tunnel. It is also the only way to travel to a secret area of {{rt|116|Hoenn}}.

After obtaining the {{badge|Stone}}, the {{player}} follows the [[Team Aqua]]{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}} or [[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}} [[Grunt]] encountered earlier in the game to this tunnel. After defeating him, the player will receive the [[Devon Parts|Devon Goods]]{{sup/3|RSE}} or [[Devon Parts]]{{sup/6|ORAS}}, which can be returned to the [[Devon Corporation]].

Later in the game, the player will find two people, separated by a pair of rocks which can be smashed using {{m|Rock Smash}}. After the rock is smashed, the man will give the player {{HM|04|Strength}}{{sup/3|RSE}} or [[Aggronite]]{{sup/6|ORAS}}.

==Construction==
Construction of the tunnel had originally begun by the [[Devon Corporation]] under the leadership of [[Mr. Stone]] in order to link Rustboro, as well as nearly the entire western half of Hoenn, to the large cities in the center of Hoenn, like [[Slateport City]] and [[Mauville City]]. The tunnel was very nearly completed when Stone realized that the heavy machinery used in the construction work was causing discomfort to the local Pokémon, {{p|Whismur}}. The project was officially canceled, though a [[Black Belt]] continued to work on it without the use of machinery. By the time of the games, only a few breakable rocks remain to block off the tunnel.

===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Rusturf Tunnel first appeared in ''[[PS218|It's Absol-utely a Bad Omen]]'', where a cave-in occured there due to an earthquake, trapping [[Wanda]]'s boyfriend {{adv|Riley}} beneath the rubble. In ''[[PS219|What Would You Do for a Whismur?]]'', {{adv|Ruby}} used his {{p|Marshtomp}}, [[Mumu]], to save Riley. The earthquake turned out to have been caused by a group of {{tc|Team Magma Grunt}}s led by {{tc|Magma Admin}} [[Courtney]]. However, when Courtney spotted Ruby, she became interested in him, grabbing him and taking him with her.

In ''[[PS220|Going to Eleven with Loudred &amp; Exploud I]]'', Courtney revealed that [[Team Magma]] had destroyed the boulders blocking the incomplete tunnel, thus effectively completing its construction. She challenged Ruby to a {{pkmn|battle}} and offered him a chance to join Team Magma. Meanwhile, the local {{p|Whismur}}, alarmed by the commotion, called in two {{p|Loudred}} and an {{p|Exploud}} to help them. The Pokémon used {{m|Hyper Voice}} together, defeating the Team Magma Grunts and clearing away the rubble that had been keeping reinforcements from reaching Ruby. In ''[[PS221|Going to Eleven with Loudred &amp; Exploud II]]'', Ruby escaped from being burned alive by Courtney with the help of Wanda, Riley, [[Gabby and Ty|Gabby, and Ty]].

==Trivia==
* Both the English and Japanese names of the tunnel are a combination of the two cities it connects (Rustboro City and Verdanturf Town, respectively).
* When the two rocks in the tunnel are smashed, they do not reappear when the player leaves and re-enters the tunnel, unlike other breakable rocks found in various locations in the game.
* In Generation III, there is {{weather|fog}} here, but it has no in-battle effect; this is because fog was not used as a {{cat|game mechanics|game mechanic}} until [[Generation IV]]. In Generation VI, there is no fog.
* Development in Rusturf Tunnel was halted due to its inhabitants being sensitive to loud noises, despite the fact that the only Pokémon found in the area naturally have {{a|Soundproof}}.
