'''Verdanturf Town''' (Japanese: '''{{j|シダケタウン}}''' ''Shidake Town'') is a small, quaint town nestled between the mountains and the plains in central western [[Hoenn]]. It is well known for its very clean air.

[[Wally]] is sent to live here with his aunt, uncle, and cousin, [[Wanda]], in order to improve his health. The town features a [[Contest Hall]] in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, as well as in their [[Generation VI]] [[remake]]s, [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]]. In {{game|Emerald}}, however, the Contest Hall is replaced with a [[Battle Tent]].

There are two ways out of Verdanturf: to the east is {{rt|117|Hoenn}} towards [[Mauville City]]; and to the north is the [[Rusturf Tunnel]], which was being constructed to link {{ci|Rustboro}} and Verdanturf. However, the construction disturbed the local {{p|Whismur}} who lived in the tunnel, and so it was canceled. [[Wanda]]'s boyfriend tried to dig the tunnel himself, but was unable to do it. After the {{player}} gets the {{Badge|Dynamo}}, they can use {{m|Rock Smash}} to complete the tunnel and open a path to {{rt|116|Hoenn}}.

==Slogan==
'''''The windswept highlands with the sweet fragrance of grass.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|くさの　においの　かぜふく　こうげん}}''' ''The highlands where the grass-scented wind blows.'')

==Places of interest==
===Contest Hall===
{{main|Contest Hall}}
In {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, the Verdanturf Town Contest Hall is where [[Rank (Contest)|Normal Rank]] [[Pokémon Contest]]s are held. It is also where [[Pokémon Coordinator]]s can register their [[Contest Pass]]es. A sign outside the building reads:

{{sign|RS|header}}
{{sign|RS|title|Pokémon Contests}}
{{sign|RS|title|Normal Rank Registration}}
{{sign|RS|"Gather here, all ye &lt;sc>Pokémon Trainers&lt;/sc>!"}}
{{sign|RS|footer}}

In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], the Contest Hall returns. [[Pokémon Contest Spectacular]]s of all four ranks are held here.

===Battle Tent===
{{main|Battle Tent}}
In {{game|Emerald}}, the Contest Hall is replaced with a Battle Tent themed after the [[Battle Palace]] in the {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}}. A sign outside the building reads:

{{sign|E|header}}
{{sign|E|title|Battle Tent Verdanturf Site}}
{{sign|E|"Feast Your Eyes on Battles!"}}
{{sign|E|footer}}

===Wanda's house===
[[Wanda]] and most of her family live in the south side of the town. [[Wally]] is sent to live here in order to improve his health, but is only seen at Wanda's house after the player battles Wally in [[Mauville City]]. After the player obtains the [[Balance Badge]], Wally will no longer be at Wanda's house.

===Friendship rater===
In the house situated to the left of Wanda's house, there is a woman who rates the [[friendship]] of {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}.

===Shroomish girl===
In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, there is a little girl between the houses of Wanda and the friendship rater who has lost her {{p|Shroomish}}. She mentions it went missing somewhere near the sign. If the player reads the sign after talking to the girl, the Shroomish will come out from behind the sign and return to the girl. As a reward for finding it, the little girl will give the player the [[Intriguing Stone]].

===Move Tutor===
In {{game|Emerald}}, inside the Pokémon Center there is a kid who will teach a compatible Pokémon {{m|Fury Cutter}} one time only.

===Poké Mart===
The [[Poké Mart]] in town is the only one in [[Hoenn]] where [[Nest Ball]]s can be purchased.

==Demographics==

==In the anime==
[[File:Verdanturf Town anime.png|thumb|left|220px|Verdanturf Town in the anime]]
In the {{pkmn|anime}}, Verdanturf Town was shown to have a fairly luxurious neighborhood. It is the [[hometown]] of [[Morrison]], a [[Pokémon Trainer]] and one of {{Ash}}'s [[rival]]s in the [[Ever Grande Conference]]. Among the town's current residents are [[Timmy Grimm]] and his parents, [[Tommy Grimm]] and [[Mrs. Grimm]], who live in a mansion.

Ash, {{an|May}}, [[Max]], and {{an|Brock}} arrived in Verdanturf Town in ''[[AG061|Disaster of Disguise]]'', where they met up with [[Drew]] again. Drew was planning to compete in the town's [[Pokémon Contest]]. However, after his {{TP|Drew|Roselia}} was injured in a {{pkmn|battle}} against Timmy's {{p|Dusclops}}, he took it to the [[Pokémon Center]] and decided not to participate.

[[File:Verdanturf Ribbon.png|thumb|220px|The Verdanturf Ribbon]]
In ''[[AG062|Disguise Da Limit!]]'', May entered the Verdanturf Contest in the hopes of winning her second [[Ribbon]]. Timmy and [[Jessie]], respectively disguised as The Phantom and Jesselana, were also among the contestants. In the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]], [[May's Skitty]] failed to deliver a successful {{m|Blizzard}} [[move|attack]]. Despite this, the {{pkmn|category|Kitten Pokémon}} was able to save its performance by juggling with {{m|Double Slap}} just like [[Dr. Abby]] taught it in ''[[AG060|Delcatty Got Your Tongue]]''. When [[Vivian Meridian|Vivian]] [[Contest announcer|announced]] the results, it was revealed that May, Timmy, Jessie, and a {{pkmn|Coordinator}} by the name of [[Stefano]] had advanced to the [[Contest Battle]]s.

After defeating Stefano, May battled Timmy in the final round. Timmy proved to be a talented Coordinator and a tough opponent for May, as he had some good [[Contest combination|combinations]] up his sleeve. This led May to lose a large amount of points. However, her Skitty managed to master the move Blizzard and use it against Dusclops, knocking it out. The [[Contest Judge]]s then called {{DL|Fainting|Battle Off}} and May was declared the winner. Afterwards, the Director of the {{pkmn|Activities Committee|Contest Committee}}, [[Raoul Contesta|Mr. Contesta]], handed her the coveted Verdanturf Ribbon, her second Contest Ribbon overall.

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Verdanturf Town appeared in ''[[PS217|Mind-Boggling with Medicham]]'' and ''[[PS218|It's Absol-utely a Bad Omen]]'', where {{adv|Ruby}} arrived there to obtain the [[Hoenn]] [[Contest Pass]] and to compete in the [[Rank (Contest)|Normal Rank]] [[Pokémon Contest]]s, accompanied by [[Gabby and Ty]]. After winning all five Normal Rank Contests, he saw a person whom he initially mistook as {{adv|Wally}}, but was actually  Wally's cousin [[Wanda]], who told him that Wally had left the town before his arrival.

==Trivia==
* In {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, a girl in the [[Poké Mart]] sings a short song when talked to, which goes: "Ball, Ball, [[Nest Ball]]. ♪ Ball, Ball, [[Luxury Ball]]. ♪" Afterwards, she says that she learned the song from "a strange person in red clothes" when she visited the [[Kalos]] region once. This is likely a reference to the {{tc|Team Flare Grunt}} who sings a similar song before being battled at the [[Poké Ball Factory]] in {{pkmn|X and Y}}.
