The '''Weather Institute''' (Japanese: '''{{tt|天気研究所|てんきけんきゅうじょ}}''' ''Weather Institute'') is a weather research building located on {{rt|119|Hoenn}} in the region of [[Hoenn]], in {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}, and {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}.

The Weather Institute is like a bureau for the Hoenn [[region]]. It checks and keeps track of weather conditions throughout Hoenn. The Weather Institute has created a {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} named {{p|Castform}}, which has the ability to predict the weather and its conditions on a specific location. Its main project is the weather control machine which allows them to change the weather in certain areas.

==Geography==
On the first trip through Route 119, the {{player}} will find that [[Team Aqua]]{{sup/3|Sa}}{{sup/3|Em}}{{sup/6|AS}} or [[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|Ru}}{{sup/6|OR}} have invaded the Institute, looking for information about {{p|Kyogre}} or {{p|Groudon}}, respectively, and the rare Pokémon, Castform. The team has also blockaded the bridge just outside the Institute, preventing access to [[Fortree City]] until the team is defeated.

This facility is used in {{game|Emerald}} to find Groudon and Kyogre after becoming {{pkmn|Champion}}. By speaking to the meteorologist inside, players will learn of unusual weather patterns in certain routes. If he says there is a drought, Groudon slumbers in the [[Terra Cave]]; if downpours are coming down, Kyogre awaits in the [[Marine Cave]]. If the {{player}} does not reach the cave fast enough, it will temporarily disappear and the other cave will appear. However, after defeating or catching one of the Pokémon, the other cave simply relocates if the player does not visit it fast enough.

The Weather Institute has two accessible stories, both with many desks and computers. On the far left side of the bottom floor is a [[PC]] and bed which can heal the Pokémon in one's [[party]].

===First floor===
Upon entering, the first floor is accessible. By going west along the entrance hallway, there will be another opening to three rooms. The room on the western side is a rest area that contains a [[PC]] and bed which can heal the Pokémon in a Trainer's [[party]].

The room on the eastern side is the research area where scientists work on projects and study weather patterns within the region. There are four workstations each containing a computer. There is also a computer positioned at the north side of the room, that will study and record all weather patterns within the [[Hoenn]] region. In the northwestern corner of the room, there are bookshelves crammed with books and there are plants scattered around the room. The stairs to the second floor is located in the northwestern corner of the room.

====Vending Machine====
In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], there is a [[Vending Machine]] on the first floor of the institute.

===Second floor===
More workstations are located on this floor along with the head of the Weather Institute's office being up here. In total, there are ten workstations each containing a computer, one of them however is missing a chair. In the northwestern corner of the room, there are bookshelves crammed with books and there are plants scattered around the room.

Right on the far western side of the room is the head of the Weather Institute's office. This is the location that [[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Team Aqua]]{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}} rounded up the residents and scientists of the Weather Institute.

Once the player defeats the villainous team and saves the Weather Institute, the professor of the institute will give the player a Castform, though in Ruby, Sapphire, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire, the player must have an empty slot in the party to obtain it.

==In the anime==
===Main series===
[[File:Weather Institute anime.png‎|thumb|250px|The Weather Institute in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]‎
{{spoilers}}
In ''[[AG083|Unfair Weather Friends]]'', {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} traveled to the Weather Institute, where they got caught up in a takeover by [[Team Aqua]]. Team Aqua planned to steal all of the facility's data on weather and ancient Pokémon, but their plan was stopped by a disguised [[Team Magma]] member named [[Brodie]], who escaped with the data himself.

[[Bart]] is the manager of the Weather Institute, which employs several scientists, including [[Millie]]. The facility contains multiple rooms with many different machines. A weather data machine stores data like temperature and weather patterns on a large computer so the employees can do tests and experiments later. There is also a huge satellite outside the institute, called the Weather Control Machine, which can manipulate the weather. The Weather Institute has archived hard copies of its research, which act as a backup if the main computer system goes down.

===Pokémon Generations===
[[File:Weather Institute PG.png‎|thumb|250px|The Weather Institute in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]
The Weather Institute appeared along with {{rt|119|Hoenn}} in ''[[PG01|The Adventure]]'', where {{ga|Red's Pikachu}} was seen battling a {{p|Vigoroth}} outside of the building.

The inside of the Weather Institute briefly appeared in a flashback in ''[[PG08|The Cavern]]''. [[Team Aqua]] was revealed to have taken over the Institute, restraining the Scientists inside and allowing [[Shelly]] to conduct research on the effects of [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] {{p|Kyogre}} on the weather of [[Hoenn]].
{{-}}

==In the manga==
[[File:Weather Institute Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Weather Institute in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Weather Institute appeared from ''[[PS208|On the Loose and Hyper With Zangoose and Seviper II]]'' to ''[[PS211|Hanging Around With Slaking III]]''. {{adv|Ruby}} and {{tc|Swimmer}} Jack fled there after being attacked by a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Zangoose}} and {{p|Seviper}}, only for Ruby to be confronted by his father [[Norman]], who had come to take him home after he had run away to participate in {{pkmn|Contest}}s. As they battled, [[Gabby and Ty]] also arrived at the site with [[Mr. Stone]]'s {{p|Castform}}.

Eventually, both Ruby and Norman fell off the side of the building, but were saved by a combination of [[Feefee|Ruby's Feebas]]'s {{m|Light Screen}} and his [[Running Shoes]], which Norman had given to him as a gift. After surviving the fall, Ruby fainted, and Norman was approached by [[Flannery]] and [[Winona]], who had come to take him back to the [[Petalburg Gym]], which he had left unattended without permission. Having no other choice, Norman left with them, telling his unconcious son to realize his dream of winning every Contest. Gabby and Ty also left [[Fofo|Castform]] with Ruby, as it had taken a liking to him.

==Trivia==
* A woman on {{rt|212|Sinnoh}} west of [[Pastoria City]] in [[Sinnoh]] says she used to work at the Weather Institute of Hoenn. She will trade [[TM]]s of weather-changing moves for [[shard]]s.
