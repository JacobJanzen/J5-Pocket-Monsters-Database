'''Terra Cave''' (Japanese: '''りくのどうくつ''' ''Land Cave'') is a cave in [[Hoenn]] that only appears in {{game|Emerald}}.

Unlike most other locations, the location of Terra Cave is not set at all; it can be determined by speaking with a man at Hoenn's [[Weather Institute]], who will explain that one of four [[route]]s is under abnormal weather conditions. If the {{player}} does not reach Terra Cave fast enough, it will temporarily disappear and [[Marine Cave]] will appear. However, once {{p|Kyogre}} is defeated/caught in Marine Cave, or if the player did not arrive there fast enough, Terra Cave will reappear and relocate. It is able to appear in places as far from each other as {{rt|115|Hoenn}} and {{rt|118|Hoenn}}, though it mostly sticks to the western side of [[Hoenn]]. In {{game|Emerald}}, it is the only place where {{p|Groudon}} can be caught. It will only appear once the Hoenn [[Pokémon League]] have been defeated, and will disappear completely after Groudon has been either caught or defeated.

Its counterpart is [[Marine Cave]], and the two caves cannot appear at the same time. The {{player}} must defeat, catch, or not visit one [[Legendary Pokémon]] before the other cave will appear.
