The '''Oceanic Museum''' (Japanese: '''{{tt|海|うみ}}の{{tt|科学博物館|かがくはくぶつかん}}''' ''Ocean Science Museum'') is a building built by [[Captain Stern]] located in [[Slateport City]].

==In the games==
In {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}, the player must go to the Oceanic Musuem give [[Captain Stern]] the [[Devon Parts]]. However, they cannot enter the museum until they have talked to [[Dock]] on the first floor of [[Stern's Shipyard]], who directs them to go to the museum to meet Captain Stern.

===Team Magma/Aqua event===
When the player first visits the museum, it has been taken over by [[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Team Aqua|Aqua]]{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}}.

One of the {{tc|Team Magma Grunt|Team Magma}}{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}}/{{tc|Team Aqua Grunt}}s{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}} visiting the museum, the same one that the player had beaten in [[Petalburg Woods]] and [[Rusturf Tunnel]], gives the player {{TM|46|Thief}}. The Grunt stays in the museum (even after the player defeats his colleagues on the second floor) until he gives the player the [[TM]] and runs off immediately after giving it to them.

When the player first visits the second floor, they are challenged by two members of the [[villainous team]].

In {{game|Emerald}}, when the player leaves the museum after defeating the Team Aqua members inside, [[Scott]] approaches the player to ask them who defeated Team Aqua.

===Exhibits===
There is a {{PDollar}}50 entrance fee to enter the museum.

The first floor contains information about the sea in the form of seven exhibits. There is also a {{tc|reporter}} who asks the player to tell him a story about Pokémon. This report will later be aired on [[television|TV]].

On the second floor, there are various exhibits, including models of the [[Hoenn]] region and several cruise ships including the [[Royal Unova]]{{sup/6|ORAS}} and the [[S.S. Anne]].

===Sign===
A sign outside the museum reads:

{{sign|E|header}}
{{sign|E|"The endless sea sustains all life."}}
{{sign|E|title|OCEANIC MUSEUM}}
{{sign|E|footer}}

==In the anime==
[[File:Oceanic Museum anime.png|thumb|250px|Oceanic Museum in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
{{Ash}} and [[Max]] visited the Oceanic Museum in ''[[AG036|The Spheal of Approval]]'', where they met [[Captain Stern]], who was analyzing a heat-affected rock sample from the ocean floor. During their visit, [[Team Magma]] tried to steal the stone sample, though Ash and Captain Stern intervened. During the squabble, the sample broke into two pieces, with Team Magma escaping with the larger portion. Captain Stern was left with the smaller fragment, though it was still sufficient enough for his research.

{{OBP|Marius|AG036}} often frequents the museum because of his passion for research and {{t|Water}} Pokémon. His favorite exhibits are the models on display, including those of a submarine and several Pokémon.

==Trivia==
* The museum's theme is a remix of the song heard on the [[S.S. Anne]].
* The museum can be entered free of charge before Team Magma or Team Aqua leave, as the reception believes that the player is part of their group. However, it only works if the player lacks the {{PDollar}}50 fee, which will prompt the receptionist to believe that the player is part of either Team Magma or Team Aqua.
* In [[Pokémon X and Y]], a {{tc|Madame}} staying on the second floor of [[Hotel Richissime]] in [[Lumiose City]] [[List of cross-generational references|mentions]] that her first date with her husband was at the Oceanic Museum.
* In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, the upper floor of the museum has water samples from both Kanto and Johto.
** This was changed in Emerald; instead, they are labeled Water Sample 1 and Water Sample 2.
** This reference returns in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, with additional water samples from [[Sinnoh]], [[Unova]], and [[Kalos]] added.
