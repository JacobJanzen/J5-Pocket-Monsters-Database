The '''Cave of Origin''' (Japanese: '''{{tt|目覚めのほこら|めざめのほこら}}''' ''{{wp|Hokora|Shrine}} of Awakening'') is a cave near the north end of [[Sootopolis City]]. It is guarded by [[Wallace]] of [[Sootopolis Gym]] and is said to be the cave where life begins. Its opposite landmark is [[Mt. Pyre]], said to be the place where life ends.

Here, the {{player}} will discover {{p|Groudon}}{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}} or {{p|Kyogre}}{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/6|AS}} in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}} and {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}} after an encounter at the [[Seafloor Cavern]] and a face-off against [[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}} or [[Team Aqua]]{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/6|AS}}.

Residents of Sootopolis are not permitted to enter the Cave of Origin.

In {{game|Emerald}}, the Cave of Origin is where Wallace can be found debating where {{p|Rayquaza}} [[Sky Pillar|is located]], until the player gives him a hint that it is at the Sky Pillar. However, the player cannot enter the cave, even after awakening Rayquaza.

==In the anime==
The Cave of Origin was mentioned in ''[[AG027|A Three Team Scheme!]]''. A group of [[Team Magma]] members led by [[Tabitha]], and a group of [[Team Aqua]] members led by [[Shelly]], initially mistook a set of ruins on [[Dewford Town|Dewford Island]] for the Cave of Origin. When they failed to find what they were looking for from the ruins, they understood their mistake and left.

==In the manga==
[[File:Cave of Origin Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Cave of Origin in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
The Cave of Origin was first mentioned in ''[[PS224|I More Than Like You, Luvdisc II]]'', where [[Wallace]] was revealed to be its guardian.

In ''[[PS250|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon XII]]'', {{Steven}} revealed that {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}} and {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}} were headed to [[Sootopolis City]] because the Cave of Origin would allow their minds to awaken now that their bodies had been awakened.

The Cave of Origin first appeared in ''[[PS261|It All Ends Now II]]'', where {{adv|Ruby}} and [[Courtney]] stood in front of it while preparing to use the [[Red Orb|Red]] and [[Blue Orb]]s in an attempt to stop Groudon and Kyogre's fight. In ''[[PS262|It All Ends Now III]]'', Courtney was suddenly pulled into the cave by a {{p|Tentacruel|tentacle}}, just as its entrance collapsed on top of her, killing her.

In ''[[PS264|It All Ends Now V]]'', [[Archie]] and [[Maxie]] emerged from the cave after Ruby and {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Rayquaza}} had succeeded in stopping Groudon and Kyogre, swiping the Orbs and intending to restart the crisis.

In the [[Chuang Yi]] translations of Pokémon Adventures volumes {{FB|Pokémon Adventures volume|19}}, {{FB|Pokémon Adventures volume|20}}, and {{FB|Pokémon Adventures volume|21}}, the [[Seafloor Cavern]] was incorrectly referred to as the Cave of Origin.

==Trivia==
* In {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}} and {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the player can reenter the cave after capturing or defeating Groudon/Kyogre. In {{game|Emerald}}, the entrance is blocked for the rest of the game after awakening Rayquaza in Sky Pillar.
* In Ruby and Sapphire, the cave is dark but can be illuminated by {{m|Flash}}. In other games, the cave is normally lit.
* Although the Cave of Origin was reduced in size for {{game|Emerald}}, data for the removed floors still exists in the game's code.
* In [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]], certain Pokémon are said to be found in the Cave of Origin. These include {{p|Pineco}}, {{p|Miltank}}, and {{p|Shuckle}}. The guide likely meant to say [[Altering Cave]], which can be found in FireRed and LeafGreen, but these Pokémon can only be found there with an event distribution that was never distributed.
* In the Generation III games, no background music plays on the bottom floor of this cave. In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, the only other area in the game that shares this distinction is the [[Inside of Truck]]. (In Pokémon Emerald, [[Birth Island]] also has no background music.)
** As a result, if a Pokémon evolves or an {{pkmn|Egg}} hatches here in these games, the evolution background music will play on the floor until the player leaves.
* In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the player's [[PokéNav Plus]] will be unusable in the bottom floor due to electrical interference from the intense natural energy in the room.
