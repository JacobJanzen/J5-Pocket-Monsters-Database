'''Stern's Shipyard''' (Japanese: '''クスノキ{{tt|造船所|ぞうせんじょ}}''' ''{{tt|Kusunoki|Stern}} Shipyard'') is a building owned by [[Captain Stern]], featured in {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}. Stern's Shipyard is a large brown building located next to the ocean. In front of the building are two houses, and around the building are three small wooden boats. It is located in the eastern part of [[Slateport City]], and is where the [[S.S. Tidal]] was constructed. The Shipyard also takes old boats and sinks them, to make [[List of Pokémon by habitat|habitats]] for the Pokémon who live around the city and its neighboring beaches.

When the player first arrives in Slateport the [[Oceanic Museum]] will be inaccessible. The player must first talk to [[Dock]] on the first floor of the Shipyard, and then head to the Museum to meet Captain Stern.

After the player obtains seven Gym Badges, [[Mr. Briney]] comes to [[Slateport City]] to help out with the construction of the ferry. Then, after the player has entered the [[Hall of Fame]], the ferry will take them to the {{gdis|Battle Tower|III}}{{sup/3|RS}} or to the {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}}{{sup/3|E}}. In {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, after the player completes the Delta Episode, they can board the ferry to the [[Battle Resort]].
