'''Birth Island''' (Japanese: '''たんじょうのしま''' ''Birth Island'') is a location near {{isl|Six}} and [[Seven Island]]s in the [[Sevii Islands]], accessible in {{game2|FireRed|LeafGreen|Emerald}}. The [[Mythical Pokémon]] {{p|Deoxys}} dwells on this island.

==In the games==
A {{player}} can reach Birth Island only after downloading the [[AuroraTicket]] through [[Mystery Gift]] and sailing there by talking to the {{tc|Sailor|sailor}} in front of the [[Seagallop|Seagallop Ferries]] in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, or by boarding the [[S.S. Tidal]] in Pokémon Emerald.

Like [[Navel Rock]], Birth Island is invisible on the [[Town Map]]{{sup/3|FRLG}} by default due to its [[event]]-only status, only appearing when the player first arrives there. This is in contrast to the other Sevii Islands, which appear on the Town Map even before the player has visited them. It also never appears on the [[PokéNav]]'s map.{{sup/3|E}}

Upon first arriving at the island, the only thing the {{player}} will find is an inert, black, triangular rock. To make {{p|Deoxys}} appear, the player must solve a strange puzzle by following the rock: each time the rock is interacted with, it will move to a different position on the island, and the player must perform the shortest possible path to the rock's new position. Each successful interaction will cause the rock to glow more; the puzzle is solved once the rock returns to one space above its original position and glows a bright red. Interacting with the rock in this state will cause it to shatter and Deoxys to appear. If the player fails to follow the shortest path before the puzzle is solved, interacting with the rock will reset the puzzle, moving the rock back to its original position and reverting it to black.

==Puzzle==
To solve the puzzle and make {{p|Deoxys}} appear, the {{player}} must do the following:

# Approach the triangle from below and press '''A'''.
# Press '''←''' 5×, '''↓''' once, then '''A'''.
# Press '''→''' 5×, '''↑''' 5×, then '''A'''.
# Press '''→''' 5×, '''↓''' 5×, then '''A'''.
# Press '''↑''' 3×, '''←''' 7×, then '''A'''.
# Press '''→''' 5×, then '''A'''.
# Press '''←''' 3×, '''↓''' 2×, then '''A'''.
# Press '''↓''' once, '''←''' 4×, then '''A'''.
# Press '''→''' 7×, then '''A'''.
# Press '''←''' 4×, '''↓''' once, then '''A'''.
# Press '''↑''' 4×, then '''A'''.

==Pokémon==
When encountered in the wild, Deoxys will appear in Normal Forme, but once captured, it will transform into Attack Forme, Defense Forme, or Speed Forme. In {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} it will transform into Attack Forme and Defense Forme respectively, and in {{game|Emerald}} it will transform into Speed Forme.

==Music==
The Birth Island itself is silent; it has no music theme. The triangular rock makes a short sound when it moves as a result of the player interacting with it. When encountering {{p|Deoxys}}, [[Pokémon FireRed &amp; Pokémon LeafGreen: Super Music Collection|''Deoxys Appears'']] plays. When {{pkmn|battle|battling}} Deoxys, the theme played is ''[[Pokémon FireRed &amp; Pokémon LeafGreen: Super Music Collection|Battle! (Deoxys)]]''. This applies to both {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} and {{game|Emerald}}.

==In the manga==

===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|FireRed &amp; LeafGreen}}====
Birth Island first appeared in ''[[PS281|Not Exactly Normal]]''. After defeating {{adv|Red}} on [[Five Island]], the {{p|Deoxys}} known as {{DL|Deoxys (Adventures)|Organism No. 2}} retired to Birth Island in order to heal the [[damage]] it had received when [[Pika]]'s {{m|Thunder}} struck its core. In order to protect itself, Organism No. 2 encased itself in a pyramid-like protection called "Delta Shield", a combination of {{m|Reflect}} and {{m|Light Screen}}. {{adv|Giovanni}}, however, took advantage of Organism No. 2's weakened state, and followed it to the island in ''[[PS282|Going Green]]''. Using his {{TP|Giovanni|Beedrill}}'s {{m|Agility}} to cut down its movements and his {{p|Aggron}}'s {{m|Brick Break}} to destroy the Delta Shield, Giovanni was able to {{pkmn2|caught|capture}} Organism No. 2 with a [[Poké Ball]] specifically designed to catch the [[Pokémon category|DNA Pokémon]].

==Trivia==
* While Birth Island is absent from {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the end of the [[Delta Episode]] alludes to it: after {{me|Rayquaza}} destroys the meteor, a triangle emerges from the remnants, darts about in the same pattern as the puzzle on Birth Island, and then breaks apart, revealing Deoxys.
