'''Lavaridge Town''' (Japanese: '''{{j|フエンタウン}}''' ''Huen Town'') is a small town in central western [[Hoenn]]. It is located on the southern foot of [[Mt. Chimney]]. The town is well known for its hot spring and is a popular destination for elderly citizens.

[[Pokémon Trainer]]s often come to Lavaridge Town in order to win the {{Badge|Heat}} from [[Flannery]], the Lavaridge [[Gym Leader]] who specializes in {{type|Fire}} Pokémon.

Northeast of the town is the [[Jagged Pass]], leading down from [[Mt. Chimney]]. East of the town is {{rt|112|Hoenn}}.

==Slogan==
'''''&lt;sc>Pokémon Center Hot Springs&lt;/sc> An excellent place for relaxing!''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|ポケセン　おんせん　よいところ}}''' ''{{pkmn|Center|Pokésen}}, {{wp|onsen}}, an excellent place.'')

==Places of interest==
===Hot springs===
The hot springs are connected to an opening in the back of the [[Pokémon Center]]. The people draw as much hot water as they need, yet the spring never runs dry. The magma in the active volcano causes veins of water nearby to well up as hot springs. According to legend, the Lavaridge hot springs calm tension, relieve muscle ache, solve romantic problems, and attract money. An old woman standing by the sand baths will give away an {{pkmn|Egg}} containing a {{p|Wynaut}}. There is also an Ice Heal hidden in the water.

In {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the hot spring is split down the middle based on gender, indicated by blue and pink doorways, but the {{player}} is able to enter either side. A gentleman in the Pokémon Center comments that the hot springs are for Pokémon only. A female {{tc|Pokémon Breeder}} in front of the hot spring entrances sells [[Moomoo Milk]] individually or by the dozen. After {{p|Groudon}}/{{p|Kyogre}} has been captured or defeated, a {{p|Kecleon}} can be discovered in the female side of the hot spring, and the old woman by the sand baths will give away a second Egg, containing a {{p|Togepi}}.

{{sign|E|footer|}}

The Herb Shop sells four different types of herbal medicine. The herbs are extremely bitter and will cause a Pokémon's [[friendship]] to decrease when used. An old man inside of the shop will give the player [[Charcoal]].

All four of the herbs in some way heal the Pokémon that they are used on but cause the Pokémon to be less [[friendship|friendly]]. The [[Energy Root]] heals a Pokémon's {{stat|HP}} by 200. The [[Energy Powder|EnergyPowder]] heals a Pokémon's HP by 50. The [[Revival Herb]] revives a fainted Pokémon with all of its HP. The [[Heal Powder]] heals any [[status condition]].

==In the anime==
[[File:Lavaridge Town anime.png|thumb|250px|Lavaridge Town in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrived in Lavaridge Town in ''[[AG055|Poetry Commotion]]'' for Ash's next [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}. They tried Lavaridge's famous hot springs and also met up with [[Flannery]], the new [[Gym Leader]] who was initially struggling with the responsibilities of running the [[Lavaridge Gym]]. Ash battled her in ''[[AG056|Going, Going, Yawn!]]'' and won his fourth [[Hoenn League]] [[Badge]], after which the group departed from Lavaridge.

In ''[[JN007|Serving Up the Flute Cup!]]'', Ash met [[Hodge]], who is from Lavaridge Town, and battled him during the [[Battle Frontier Flute Cup]].

In ''[[JN064|Absol Absolved!]]'', Ash and [[Goh]] visited Lavaridge Town at the request of Hodge to investigate a problem with their hot springs. After solving the problem on [[Mt. Chimney]], they took a bath in the hot springs before returning to [[Kanto]]

==In the manga==
[[File:Lavaridge Town Adventures.png|thumb|150px|Lavaridge Town in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Lavaridge Town first appeared in ''[[PS212|Bubble Bubble Toil and Azumarill I]]''. After winning her 149th consecutive victory at the [[Lavaridge Gym]], [[Flannery]] was contacted by [[Winona]] and informed of {{adv|Sapphire}}, who had earned three [[Badge]]s already and was headed to Lavaridge Town. Flannery stepped out of the Gym to cool off and yelled out that she was going to accept Sapphire's challenge. [[Shelly]] and [[Matt]] overheard her, and, assuming that she knew Sapphire, proceeded to kidnap her.

In ''[[PS214|Assaulted by Pelipper I]]'', after [[Team Aqua]] succeeded in using the [[Meteorite]] to make [[Mt. Chimney]] become dormant, the hot springs in Lavaridge Town cooled down, along with the rest of the town, causing confusion and panic. In ''[[PS215|Assaulted by Pelipper II]]'', a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Absol}} was seen looking over the panicking town.

In ''[[PS267|It All Ends Now VIII]]'', Flannery was seen welcoming people, including [[Tabitha]], to the restored hot springs.
