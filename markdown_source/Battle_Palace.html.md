The '''Battle Palace''' (Japanese: '''バトルパレス''' ''Battle Palace'') is a [[Battle facility|facility]] located within the [[Hoenn]] {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} in {{game|Emerald}}.

==Challenges==
In the Battle Palace, Pokémon battle on their own, without any commands from their Trainers. This is very similar to the rules at the {{to|Verdanturf}} [[Battle Tent]]. The style of the Pokémon's battle depends on its [[Nature]], and this style may change when the Pokémon's HP falls low.

At a streak of 21 (three trips through) or 42 (six trips through), [[Spenser]] challenges the player. If defeated, he awards the Spirits Symbol.

===Battle style===
Depending on its Nature, a Pokémon may use different moves in the Battle Palace. All moves belong to one of three categories: Attack, Defense, or Support. The following is the list of attacks in each category:
* '''Attack''': Any move not listed under Defense or Support.
* '''Defense''': All moves that target the user, the user's side, or the entire field, but not {{cat|moves that call other moves}}. These moves include {{m|Acid Armor}}, {{m|Agility}}, {{m|Amnesia}}, {{m|Aromatherapy}}, {{m|Barrier}}, {{m|Baton Pass}}, {{m|Belly Drum}}, {{m|Bide}}, {{m|Bulk Up}}, {{m|Calm Mind}}, {{m|Camouflage}}, {{m|Charge}}, {{m|Conversion 2}}, {{m|Conversion}}, {{m|Cosmic Power}}, {{m|Defense Curl}}, {{m|Destiny Bond}}, {{m|Detect}}, {{m|Double Team}}, {{m|Dragon Dance}}, {{m|Endure}}, {{m|Focus Energy}}, {{m|Follow Me}}, {{m|Growth}}, {{m|Grudge}}, {{m|Hail}}, {{m|Harden}}, {{m|Haze}}, {{m|Heal Bell}}, {{m|Helping Hand}}, {{m|Howl}}, {{m|Imprison}}, {{m|Ingrain}}, {{m|Iron Defense}}, {{m|Light Screen}}, {{m|Meditate}}, {{m|Milk Drink}}, {{m|Minimize}}, {{m|Mist}}, {{m|Moonlight}}, {{m|Morning Sun}}, {{m|Mud Sport}}, {{m|Perish Song}}, {{m|Protect}}, {{m|Rain Dance}}, {{m|Recover}}, {{m|Recycle}}, {{m|Reflect}}, {{m|Refresh}}, {{m|Rest}}, {{m|Safeguard}}, {{m|Sandstorm}}, {{m|Sharpen}}, {{m|Slack Off}}, {{m|Soft-Boiled|Softboiled}}, {{m|Splash}}, {{m|Stockpile}}, {{m|Substitute}}, {{m|Sunny Day}}, {{m|Swallow}}, {{m|Swords Dance}}, {{m|Synthesis}}, {{m|Tail Glow}}, {{m|Teleport}}, {{m|Water Sport}}, {{m|Wish}}, and {{m|Withdraw}}.
* '''Support''': All moves that do not deal damage and are not categorized under Defense, as well as {{m|Counter}} and {{m|Mirror Coat}}. These include {{m|Assist}}, {{m|Attract}}, {{m|Block}}, {{m|Charm}}, {{m|Confuse Ray}}, {{m|Cotton Spore}}, {{m|Counter}}, {{m|Curse}}, {{m|Disable}}, {{m|Encore}}, {{m|Fake Tears}}, {{m|Feather Dance|FeatherDance}}, {{m|Flash}}, {{m|Flatter}}, {{m|Foresight}}, {{m|Glare}}, {{m|Grass Whistle|GrassWhistle}}, {{m|Growl}}, {{m|Hypnosis}}, {{m|Kinesis}}, {{m|Leech Seed}}, {{m|Leer}}, {{m|Lock-On}}, {{m|Lovely Kiss}}, {{m|Magic Coat}}, {{m|Mean Look}}, {{m|Memento}}, {{m|Metal Sound}}, {{m|Metronome}}, {{m|Mimic}}, {{m|Mind Reader}}, {{m|Mirror Coat}}, {{m|Mirror Move}}, {{m|Nature Power}}, {{m|Nightmare}}, {{m|Odor Sleuth}}, {{m|Pain Split}}, {{m|Poison Gas}}, {{m|Poison Powder|PoisonPowder}}, {{m|Psych Up}}, {{m|Roar}}, {{m|Role Play}}, {{m|Sand Attack|Sand-Attack}}, {{m|Scary Face}}, {{m|Screech}}, {{m|Sing}}, {{m|Sketch}}, {{m|Skill Swap}}, {{m|Sleep Powder}}, {{m|Sleep Talk}}, {{m|Smokescreen|SmokeScreen}}, {{m|Snatch}}, {{m|Spider Web}}, {{m|Spikes}}, {{m|Spite}}, {{m|Spore}}, {{m|String Shot}}, {{m|Stun Spore}}, {{m|Supersonic}}, {{m|Swagger}}, {{m|Sweet Kiss}}, {{m|Sweet Scent}}, {{m|Tail Whip}}, {{m|Taunt}}, {{m|Teeter Dance}}, {{m|Thunder Wave}}, {{m|Tickle}}, {{m|Torment}}, {{m|Toxic}}, {{m|Transform}}, {{m|Trick}}, {{m|Whirlwind}}, {{m|Will-O-Wisp}}, and {{m|Yawn}}.

Each Nature has a set of ratios that determines how often a Pokémon with that Nature is likely to use Attack, Defense, or Support moves. These ratios change when the Pokémon's HP falls below 50%. During battle, a category is selected for a given turn, and one of the Pokémon's moves in that category is chosen with the game's AI. If the Pokémon has no move in the selected category, the Pokémon will pick one of its moves at random, but there will also be a 50% chance that the Pokémon will "appear incapable of using its power" and skip its turn.

The following table lists each Nature and its move type preferences; it may be rearranged by clicking the boxes next to each column's heading.

At the end of a turn, if a Pokémon is at or below 50% of its maximum HP, a message is shown to indicate that its battle style is changing. Which message is shown depends on its Nature:

{| class="roundy" style="text-align:center; background: #a0a0c4; border: 5px solid #bbbbe8"
|-
! style="background-color: #ccf; {{roundytl|5px}}" | Nature
! style="background-color: #ccf; {{roundytr|5px}}" | Message
|- style="background: #ddf"
|Lonely, Adamant, Naughty, Relaxed, Hasty, Gentle
|''"A glint appears in &lt;Pokémon>'s eyes!"''
|- style="background: #ddf"
|Brave, Bold, Impish, Jolly, Modest, Calm
|''"&lt;Pokémon> is getting into position!"''
|- style="background: #ddf"
|Lax, Timid, Mild, Rash, Sassy, Careful
|''"&lt;Pokémon> began growling deeply!"''
|- style="background: #ddf"
| style="{{roundybl|5px}}" | Hardy, Docile, Serious, Naive, Quiet, Bashful, Quirky
| style="{{roundybr|5px}}" | ''"&lt;Pokémon> is eager for more!"''
|}

In a [[Double Battle]], each Pokémon selects the target of its moves based on its Nature.
* If its Nature is Hardy, Lonely, Adamant, Relaxed, Impish, Lax, Jolly, Mild, Rash, Calm, Gentle, or Quirky, it will target the foe with greater HP.
* If its Nature is Brave, Naughty, Bold, Timid, Hasty, Serious, Modest, Quiet, Bashful, Sassy, or Careful, it will target the foe with less HP.
* If both foes have the same HP, or if the attacker's Nature is Docile or Naive, a random foe will be selected.

==In the anime==
[[File:Battle Palace anime.png|thumb|left|220px|The Battle Palace in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
[[File:Battle Palace battlefield.png|thumb|250px|The Battle Palace's battlefield in the anime]]
The Battle Palace appeared in ''[[AG164|Ka Boom with a View!]]''. In the anime, it is located on [[Metallica Island]], near [[Seafoam Islands]], and was the fifth {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} facility challenged by {{Ash}}. {{ashfr|The group}} discovered its location in ''[[AG158|Queen of the Serpentine!]]'', following Ash's victory against [[Lucy]] at the [[Battle Pike]]. It is run by [[Spenser]], and the {{pkmn|battle}}s are [[Battle judge|refereed]] by a hovering robot called {{DL|Battle judge|Jamero}}.

The battle against the Palace Maven does not take place inside the Battle Palace itself, instead starting from a battlefield on a nearby plateau and then moving on into the surrounding jungle and beach. As a result, {{an|May}}, [[Max]], and {{an|Brock}} watched the battle from a hot-air balloon alongside [[Scott]]. In contrast with [[Gym]]s, where challengers face [[Gym Leader|Leaders]] in consecutive battles, Spenser may interrupt a match at any moment to rest.

After an eventful battle, in which Ash used his {{AP|Sceptile}}, {{AP|Heracross}}, and {{AP|Swellow}}, he was able to defeat Spenser and earn himself the [[Symbol|Spirits Symbol]], his fifth Frontier Symbol overall.

===Pokémon used in the Battle Palace===
The following is a list of {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} used in the Battle Palace:
{{TrainerPoké
|trainer=Spenser
|pkmn=Shiftry
|type1=Grass
|type2=Dark
|img=Spenser Shiftry.png
|epnum=AG164
|epname=Ka Boom with a View!
|desc={{p|Shiftry}} was the first Pokémon to be sent against Ash, while he chose {{AP|Sceptile}}. Before using any move, Shiftry dodged the {{m|Bullet Seed}} from Sceptile and was told to move to the jungle. It had immense speed, but Sceptile was just as fast, as it followed close behind. After the two Grass types reached a small waterfall, both continued their duel. Shiftry managed to push Sceptile into the pool of water, then used {{m|Rock Smash}} to send rocks down into the pool. However, Sceptile escaped up through the waterfall and landed a hit on Shiftry, knocking it out, and winning Ash the first victory.

Shiftry's known moves are {{m|Shadow Ball}}, {{m|Quick Attack}}, {{m|Double Team}}, and {{m|Rock Smash}}.}}

{{TrainerPoké
|trainer=Spenser
|pkmn=Venusaur
|type1=Grass
|type2=Poison
|img=Spenser Venusaur.png
|epnum=AG163
|epname=Cutting the Ties that Bind
|vajp=Kenta Miyake
|vaen=Craig Blair
|desc={{p|Venusaur}} was the second Pokémon Spenser used in his {{pkmn|battle}} with Ash, first off facing his {{AP|Heracross}}. Heracross was able to put up a good fight, but it was eventually defeated by Venusaur's powerful {{m|Solar Beam}}. Ash then sent out {{AP|Swellow}}, who utilized its speed and agility to its full advantage. It was able to defeat Venusaur after a hard-fought battle.

Venusaur's known moves are {{m|Sweet Scent}}, {{m|Vine Whip}}, {{m|Razor Leaf}}, {{m|Tackle}}, and {{m|Solar Beam}}.}}

{{TrainerPoké
|trainer=Spenser
|pkmn=Claydol
|type1=Ground
|type2=Psychic
|img=Spenser Claydol.png
|epnum=AG164
|epname=Ka Boom with a View!
|vajp=Kōichi Sakaguchi
|vaen=Kōichi Sakaguchi
|desc={{p|Claydol}} was the third Pokémon to be sent out against Ash. Claydol had to face Ash's {{AP|Swellow}} and {{AP|Sceptile}} before being defeated by Sceptile's newly learned {{m|Solar Beam}}. Claydol is the powerhouse of Spenser's team.

Claydol's known moves are {{m|Teleport}}, {{m|Rapid Spin}}, {{m|Sandstorm}}, {{m|Hyper Beam}}, and {{m|Psybeam}}.}}

==In the manga==
===Pokémon Adventures===
[[File:Battle Palace Adventures.png|thumb|250px|The Battle Palace in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===={{chap|Emerald}}====
The Battle Palace first appeared in ''[[PS318|Sneaky Like Shedinja II]]'', where Spenser retreated there to rest after the [[Frontier Brain]]s' confrontation with [[Guile Hideout]] in [[Artisan Cave]].

In ''[[PS324|A Cheeky Charizard Change-Up II]]'', after having lost his battle against [[Tucker]] at the [[Battle Dome]], {{adv|Emerald}} immediately went to the Battle Palace, requesting Spenser to have a battle with him, so that he could also have time to rechallenge the Battle Dome before the Battle Frontier's seven-day opening ceremony ended. Spenser accepted the request, deciding that the battle would happen behind closed doors, without being observed by the press. He also allowed Emerald to skip the 41 virtual {{pkmn|Trainer}}s that a challenger would usually need to defeat in order to face him.

When Emerald asked what the facility's rules were in order to choose the proper Pokémon for the facility, Spenser surprised him by informing that in the Battle Palace, Trainers must use Pokémon they trust, since they're not allowed to give them any orders during the battle. He also noted how Emerald hadn't trusted in his own Pokémon at the Battle Dome and had chosen to use borrowed ones instead, which had led to his defeat by Tucker.

The two then received a message from [[Noland]], informing them that Guile Hideout had succeded in {{pkmn2|caught|catching}} {{adv|Jirachi}} and was headed to the {{gdis|Battle Tower|III}}. Emerald asked if they could postpone their battle, but Spenser reminded him that in this battle, the Trainer's presence wasn't even required, so he could just go on ahead and leave his Pokémon behind to do the battling. As such, Emerald gave his Pokémon a motivational speech before heading to the Battle Tower. In ''[[PS327|Facing Gulpin Is Hard to Swallow]]'', {{DL|Eon duo (Adventures)|Latios}} delivered Emerald's Pokémon and a [[Symbol|Spirits Symbol]] to the Battle Tower, informing Emerald that his Pokémon had won the battle against Spenser.
