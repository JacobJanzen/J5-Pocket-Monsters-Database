The '''Abandoned Ship''' (Japanese: '''すてられ{{tt|船|ぶね}}''' ''Abandoned Ship'') is a wrecked ship located on {{rt|108|Hoenn}} in [[Hoenn]], originally being a ship named the '''S.S. Cactus''' (Japanese: '''カクタスごう''' ''Cactus''). The second part of the ship can only be accessed by using {{m|Dive}} and contains the [[Scanner]].

In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, [[Sea Mauville]] takes the place of the Abandoned Ship.

==Geography==
The Abandoned Ship is a tattered, old ship that looks like it could carry passengers and cargo when it was in operation. This old ship has many rusted holes, broken doors and items of furniture scattered around rooms. One room has a huge pool of water, in which the {{player}} can dive down to reach a lower floor. The Abandoned Ship has 20 accessible rooms including a captain's office and underwater rooms.

Many Trainers train their Pokémon in the Abandoned Ship, mostly {{tc|Tuber}}s and {{tc|Sailor}}s, but also a {{tc|Young Couple}}, who battle the player in a [[Double Battle]].

After {{m|Dive}} is used to access the second part of the ship, the player will encounter five locked doors. As soon as a room is entered, a few spots in the room will gleam, showing that there is something there (either a key or "trash"). The gleams only happen just after the room is entered through the door. The player should check for keys on the gleaming spaces like other hidden items: by facing the space and pressing the 'A' button (standing on the space will not work). Once the key is found, the player can use the new key to access the next room.

==History==
The Abandoned Ship is mentioned by a character in the [[Oceanic Museum]], saying that the model of the [[S.S. Anne]] reminds him of the Abandoned Ship. The ship contained a rare [[Scanner]] when it sank and it is now buried deep within the ship.

==Items==
The Abandoned Ship cannot be accessed without {{m|Surf}}, so all items located here require Surf to obtain.

==In the anime==
[[File:Abandoned Ship anime.png|250px|thumb|The Forsaken Ship in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
The Abandoned Ship, known as the Forsaken Ship in the [[dub]], appeared in ''[[AG032|Abandon Ship!]]''.

The ship was capsized many years ago during a storm, though all of the passengers, including {{OBP|Tommy|AG032}}, were safely evacuated. However, Tommy's {{p|Marshtomp}} was accidentally left behind during the chaos, as it was outside of its {{i|Poké Ball}} at the time. Since the crash, the shipwreck has suffered from significant water inundation and is now inhabited by a large array of {{type|Water}} Pokémon. Tommy's Marshtomp also [[Evolution|evolved]] into a {{p|Swampert}}.

Years later, Tommy returned to the Forsaken Ship to search for his Marshtomp. {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} also arrived on the ship after the boat they were on ran out of fuel and drifted them over to the wreck. A search soon began when [[May's Torchic]] went missing aboard, and later, Swampert was revealed to have been responsible for kidnapping Torchic, {{an|May}}, [[Max]], and {{TRT}}, all as part of an effort to protect its new home. Tommy immediately recognized Swampert as his Marshtomp. After convincing Swampert he had returned for it, Tommy stayed aboard the ship to renovate it as a haven for the many [[wild Pokémon]] that now call it home. Tommy later escorted the group to  [[Slateport City]] with his speedboat.

==In the manga==
[[File:Abandoned Ship Adventures.png|250px|thumb|The Abandoned Ship in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
The Abandoned Ship first appeared in ''[[PS198|Adding It Up with Plusle &amp; Minun I]]'' and ''[[PS199|II]]'', where {{adv|Ruby}} and {{adv|Sapphire}} wandered to the site while surfing through {{rt|108|Hoenn}} on Sapphire's {{p|Wailord|Lorry}}. Sapphire tossed Ruby onto the ship to spend his night there, preferring to sleep on Lorry's back herself. Aboard the ship, Ruby found multiple [[Berry]] trees that had grown from the Berries carried aboard the ship, as well as a {{TP|Ruby|Plusle}} and a {{TP|Sapphire|Minun}}, who started playing tricks on him and his Pokémon.

However, Ruby and Sapphire found the ship and themselves being attacked by [[Tabitha]] and [[Courtney]] of [[Team Magma]], who were after the rare [[Scanner]] aboard the ship. Using Plusle and Minun to fight the two {{tc|Magma Admin}}s, the two [[Pokédex holder]]s eventually managed to escape with their lives, although the villains still managed to get their hands on the Scanner.

The Abandoned Ship appeared again in ''[[PS234|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon II]]'', where it was destroyed by {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}} after it had been awakened by [[Maxie]], sending Plusle and Minun to drift in the ocean. In ''[[PS246|Can I Ninjask You a Question?]]'' and ''[[PS247|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon IX]]'', [[Wattson]], [[Flannery]], and [[Winona]] engaged the three {{tc|Aqua Admin|Admins}} of [[Team Aqua]] at the site of the Abandoned Ship, doing their best to stop Kyogre's advancement through Hoenn. The battle was [[PS250|eventually]] called off by [[Shelly]] when she deemed that it was too late for the [[Gym Leader]]s to do anything to stop Kyogre.

==Trivia==
* In {{2v2|Ruby|Sapphire}}, Tuber Charlie is affected by a minor [[glitch]] which also affects {{tc|Aroma Lady}} Rose on {{rt|118|Hoenn}} and {{tc|Gentleman}} Walter on {{rt|121|Hoenn}}. Because he always approaches the player if he catches sight of them, he will walk right through a wall if it is in front of him. This glitch was corrected in Emerald as well as Spanish versions of Ruby and Sapphire.
* If Tuber Charlie spots the player character on the "stairs" of the ship and challenges them to a battle, the battle terrain is that of a cave instead of a building.
