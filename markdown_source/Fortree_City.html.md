'''Fortree City''' (Japanese: '''{{j|ヒワマキシティ}}''' ''Hiwamaki City'') is a city, roughly between {{ci|Mauville}} and {{ci|Lilycove}}, in the [[Hoenn]] region. To its west are {{rt|119|Hoenn}} and the [[Weather Institute]], and to its east {{rt|120|Hoenn}} and the {{safari|Hoenn}}. The city's motto is "The Treetop City that Frolics with Nature."

The residents of Fortree City live in treehouses and get around by a system of rope bridges that hang in the treetops. Due to the physical exertion needed for such a lifestyle, they are all healthy and fit, and by preserving Fortree's natural environment they are able to live nearer to wild Pokémon than the residents of most other cities. Wild {{type|Bug}} Pokémon often fly in through the windows, and from time to time wild {{p|Kecleon}} will block paths in the city. The heavy rainfall saturates the soil and lets the trees grow tall.

==Slogan==
'''''The treetop city that frolics with nature.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|きの　うえで　しぜんと　たわむれる　まち}}''' ''The treetop city that frolics with nature.'')

==Places of interest==
===Residential houses===
A woman in one of the houses of Fortree City will give away {{TM|10|Hidden Power}} if the {{player}} can guess which hand she is hiding a coin in three times. Also in {{game|Emerald}}, in this same house there is an old man who will teach a compatible Pokémon {{m|Sleep Talk}} one time only.

A boy in one of the houses will [[In-game trade|trade]] his {{p|Skitty}} ([[nickname]]d Skitit) for a {{p|Pikachu}} in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, and his {{p|Plusle}} (nicknamed Pluses) for a {{p|Volbeat}} in {{game|Emerald}}. In {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Elyssa will trade her {{p|Skitty}} ([[nickname]]d Skitit) for a {{p|Spinda}}.

===Desk and chair shop===
In Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, there is a shop in the southeastern corner of Fortree City that sells a variety of [[Secret Base]] decorations. There are two counters, the one on the left is selling [[desk]]s and the one on the right is selling [[chair]]s.

===Secret Base Guild===
In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the Secret Base decoration shop is replaced with the Secret Base Guild. This is where the player can meet and battle [[Aarune]], and also serves as a place to buy Secret Base decorations from. Some items are only available after the player has achieved a certain rank for their Secret Base team.

===Fortree Gym===
{{main|Fortree Gym}}
The Fortree Gym is the official Gym of Fortree City. Fortree's [[Gym Leader]], [[Winona]], uses {{type|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. When defeated, she awards the challenger the {{Badge|Feather}}, which allows the player to use {{m|Fly}} outside of battle, as well as {{TM|40|Aerial Ace}} in {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}} and {{TM|19|Roost}} in [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]]. Fortree Gym is inaccessible at first due to an invisible {{p|Kecleon}} blocking the path; the player must use the [[Devon Scope]], given to the player on {{rt|120|Hoenn}} by {{Steven}}, to gain access to the Gym.

==In the anime==
[[File:Fortree City anime.png|thumb|250px|Fortree City in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrived in Fortree City in ''[[AG084|Who's Flying Now?]]'', just in time for its annual [[Feather Carnival]], where people celebrate {{pkmn2|wild}} {{type|Flying}} Pokémon. During the festivities, they met [[Winona]], the local [[Gym Leader]], who was giving out rides on her {{pkmn2|giant}} {{p|Skarmory}}. [[James]] also encountered the [[Magikarp salesman]], who sold him what he claimed to be a {{p|Chimecho}}, which James had wanted since his childhood, but turned out to be a disguised {{p|Hoppip}}. Soon after, James however came across a real {{TP|James|Chimecho}}, which happily joined his [[party|team]]. {{TRT}} later gatecrashed the festivities and attempted to steal all of the Flying Pokémon, though Winona, Ash, and his friends intervened. The interruption, however, meant that Ash's scheduled [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}} had to be rescheduled for the following day.

In ''[[AG085|Sky High Gym Battle!]]'', Ash had his battle against Winona and defeated her, earning his sixth [[Hoenn League]] [[Badge]].

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Fortree City debuted in ''[[PS222|Short Shift for Shiftry]]'', where a meeting between the [[Gym Leader]]s of [[Hoenn]] took place there. Although [[Flannery]] had been the one to arrange the meeting following [[Mt. Chimney]] becoming dormant, it was held in Fortree due to [[Winona]] being responsible on supervising the other Hoenn Gym Leaders. [[Tate and Liza]] were unable to attend the meeting, due to them having to guard the [[Red Orb|Red]] and [[Blue Orb]]s on [[Mt. Pyre]]. [[Wallace]], who was attending business in [[Fallarbor Town]], participated the meeting via webcam. The Gym Leaders voted on whether to side with [[Team Magma]] or [[Team Aqua]], but [[Norman]] refused to cast the deciding vote, choosing to remain neutral, and proceeded to leave the meeting.

In ''[[PS226|I Dare Ya, Altaria... Knock Chic off My Shoulder]]'', {{adv|Sapphire}} arrived in Fortree and challenged Winona to a [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}, only to be defeated, although Winona did agree to coach her. Soon after, {{adv|Ruby}} arrived in Fortree as well with Wallace. Ruby and Sapphire wound up getting into an argument, following which Ruby left Fortree on his own in ''[[PS231|Master Class with Masquerain]]'', forcing Wallace to chase him. Sapphire, meanwhile, trained with Winona until she earned the {{badge|Feather}}.

In ''[[PS234|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon II]]'', the Gym Leaders learned of the tsunami that had flooded {{to|Dewford}}, {{ci|Slateport}}, and {{to|Littleroot}}, following {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}}'s awakening. In ''[[PS235|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon III]]'', {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}}'s awakening caused Fortree to be struck by a massive heat wave, withering all local plant life. The [[Pokémon Association]] Chairman subsequently ordered all the Gym Leaders present to head out to deal with the threat.
