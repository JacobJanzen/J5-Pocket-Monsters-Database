The '''Mossdeep Space Center''' (Japanese: '''トクサネ{{tt|宇宙|うちゅう}}センター''' ''{{tt|Tokusane|Mossdeep}} Space Center'') is located in [[Mossdeep City]]. This destination was chosen because of Mossdeep's ideal weather, clear and sunny with stable winds. The Space Center successfully sends rockets into space, though specifics of the space missions are unknown. There is a white rock outside which holds a special meaning to the people at the space center; it is a symbol of their wish for their rockets to fly safely.

==In the games==
[[File:Mossdeep City Space Center RS.png|thumb|200px|The Mossdeep Space Center as depicted in {{2v2|Ruby|Sapphire}}]]
Many scientists work here and are dedicated to the rocket launches' success. The Space Center contains many blueprints of rockets, machines and computers, and has two accessible floors.

In the game, a man by the window will reveal the number of successful launches there have been. Another person in the Space Center will give the {{player}} a [[Sun Stone]].

===Pokémon Emerald===
In {{game|Emerald}}, after failing to take control of {{p|Groudon}}, [[Team Magma]] tries to obtain the rocket fuel there to use to make [[Mt. Chimney]] erupt. They send a letter to the Space Center, informing them that they will take the rocket fuel, causing a panic. After the player obtains the {{badge|Mind}}, Team Magma attacks the center, and the player must enter the Space Center and defeat all of the {{tc|Team Magma Grunt}}s on the first floor in order to go to the second floor. On the second floor, the {{player}} meets up with [[Steven Stone]] and pairs up with him to [[Multi Battle]] against [[Maxie]] and [[Tabitha]].

===Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire===
====Delta Episode====
{{spoilers}}
At the start of the [[Delta Episode]], Scientists at the Space Center notice that an asteroid has changed its trajectory and is now on a collision course with the planet. In order to stop it, the Scientists lead by [[Professor Cozmo]] intend to use a rocket full of [[Infinity Energy]] as well as the energy of human (which is found in [[Key Stone]]s) to create a warp hole (using the same technology as [[warp tile]]s) to take the asteroid off collision course with the planet. Using the [[Game Link Cable|Link Cable]], they can control where the asteroid will land, but this requires a large amount of energy from [[Meteorite Shard]]s.

During the Delta Episode, before the player obtains the Meteorite Shard, the player is denied access to the second floor due to the scientists focusing on the incoming asteroid.

After the player obtains a Meteorite Shard from [[Zinnia]] in [[Granite Cave]], the player receives an Entry Call on their [[PokéNav Plus]] from Steven, who requests that the player meet him at the Mossdeep Space Center. On the second floor, Professor Cozmo and Steven await the player. When the player arrives there, Professor Cozmo explains the current plan to warp to asteroid, but is interrupted by Zinnia, who warns them that they are making a mistake greater than that of [[AZ]] when he used the [[ultimate weapon]] 3,000 years ago. Despite her warnings, Steven and Cozmo are unfazed, and request that the player retrieve another Meteorite Shard to continue the plan, but this time require one from [[Meteor Falls]].

After the player confronts [[Team Magma]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Team Aqua]]{{sup/6|AS}} outside the [[Devon Corporation]] building in [[Rustboro City]], [[Courtney]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Matt]]{{sup/6|AS}} leads the quintuplets and another Grunt in a raid on the Space Center. The villainous team admin intends to blow up the rocket, which contains more [[Infinity Energy]] than the ultimate weapon, with the aid of a Key Stone found at the [[Meteor Falls]] to complete [[Project AZOTH]], saying that blowing up the rocket would be analogous to it [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolving]]. Once they are stopped, [[Zinnia]] appears and takes the dimensional shifter controller and crushes it in her hand, rendering the plan to stop the [[Grand Meteor Delta|meteoroid]] useless. She warns that using the dimensional shifter would have sent the asteroid into [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire Versions|another world]], in which the ultimate weapon was never built, so lacked the technology to avert the asteroid. She then takes Courtney{{sup/6|OR}}/Matt{{sup/6|AS}}'s Key Stone and announces her plan to steal [[Maxie]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Archie]]{{sup/6|AS}}'s.

After receiving the [[Cameruptite]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Sharpedonite]]{{sup/6|AS}} from [[Tabitha]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Shelly]]{{sup/6|AS}} in the [[Team Magma Hideout]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Team Aqua Hideout]]{{sup/6|AS}}, the player receives an Entry Call on their PokéNav Plus from Steven, who requests that the player meet him at the Mossdeep Space Center. On the second floor, Professor Cozmo and Steven await the player. When the player arrives there, Steven explains that very few people can enter [[Sky Pillar]], such as Lorekeepers. He then suggests that the player ask [[Wallace]] for help, who has inherited the ancient lore to be able to break the seal preventing access to the Sky Pillar, who can be found outside the [[Cave of Origin]].

==Rumors==
In the games, a man by the window will reveal the number of successful launches there have been; the number is an indicator to the number of weeks since the saved game was begun. Because this is a time-based event, the Space Center will cease to launch Rockets when the battery for the internal clock runs dry, and it can be affected by the [[berry glitch]].

Many rumors have been spread about this number and its relation to {{p|Jirachi}} and {{p|Deoxys}}. Many believe that if the man reaches a certain number, the player will be able to ride a rocket into space and battle Jirachi or Deoxys. Like the {{DL|S.S. Anne|Rumors|truck rumors}} of Generation I, this rumor is false. In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|the remakes]], however, it is in fact [[Delta Episode|possible]] to go to space and battle Deoxys, perhaps in reference to these rumors.

==In the anime==
===Main series===
[[File:Mossdeep Space Center anime.png|thumb|250px|Mossdeep Space Center in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
In ''[[AG099|It's Still Rocket Roll to Me!]]'', {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} visited the Space Center in order to find the [[Mossdeep Gym]] [[Gym Leader|Leader]], although [[Max]] was also wanting to see the launch of a {{wp|space shuttle}}. They eventually found [[Tate and Liza]] battling in a room, where four {{p|Baltoy}} were creating a weightless space with their {{m|Confusion}}. There, Ash was surprised to learn that the [[Mossdeep Gym]] had two Gym Leaders.

Soon after, {{TRT}} made a brazen attempt to steal the space shuttle. However, with the help of Max and Tate, who had sneaked into the shuttle earlier, their plans were foiled. Later on, the shuttle was successfully launched for a space expedition.

In ''[[SM145|Dreams of the Sun and Moon!]]'', {{an|Sophocles}} mentioned that he had plans to visit [[Mossdeep City]] and the Mossdeep Space Center with [[Molayne]] for his upcoming vacation. They departed for said vacation in [[SM146|the next episode]]. Sophocles had returned from the Space Center by ''[[JN037|That New Old Gang of Mine!]]'', but planned to visit again to research space Pokémon.

In the anime, the Space Center contains many training machines for astronauts, such as a Moon walker to simulate walking on the Moon in low gravity, a MAT (Multi-Axis Trainer) that spins people around, and a space shuttle simulator. According to Max, Mossdeep's space program has previously launched the {{p|Sunflora}} Weather Satellite, {{p|Ho-Oh}} Three, and several manned space probes into space.

===Pokémon Generations===
[[File:Mossdeep Space Center PG.png|thumb|left|250px|Mossdeep Space Center in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]
[[File:Mossdeep Space Center interior PG.png|250px|thumb|Mossdeep Space Center interior in Pokémon Generations]]
The Mossdeep Space Center debuted in the background in ''[[PG08|The Cavern]]'', being situated near the [[Seafloor Cavern]], where [[Archie]] was attempting to reawaken [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] {{p|Kyogre}}.

The facility appeared again as the main setting of ''[[PG09|The Scoop]]''. Here, [[Gabby and Ty]] had infiltrated the Space Center whilst trying to find out some information about the destruction of the [[Grand Meteor Delta]]. While there, Gabby was able to download secret satellite footage of the event, showing that the Meteor was destroyed by a {{me|Rayquaza}} ridden by {{player|a Trainer}}. They also discovered that the Meteor had contained an {{p|Deoxys|unknown Pokémon from outer space}}, which was {{pkmn2|caught}} by the Trainer after a {{pkmn|battle}}. When attempting to leave with the footage, they were nearly caught by [[Professor Cozmo]], who believed that the world was not yet ready to know the truth behind the events.

==In the manga==
===Pokémon Adventures===
[[File:Mossdeep Space Center Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Mossdeep Space Center in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PS243|No Armaldo Is an Island]]'', [[Courtney]] raided the Mossdeep Space Center in order to collect information that would be passed on to {{adv|Ruby}} some time later in ''[[PS263|It All Ends Now IV]]''.

===={{chap|FireRed &amp; LeafGreen}}====
In ''[[PS296|It's Starting to Make Sense Now]]'', [[Sird]] revealed that cylinders containing two alien life forms, both of which grew into a {{adv|Deoxys}} later on, had been guarded in the Mossdeep Space Center. After Courtney had raided the building, Sird managed to smuggle the cylinders away, and left it to the [[Team Rocket Elite Trio|Elite Trio]] of [[Team Rocket]] to transport them back to their base in [[Kanto]] aboard the [[Team Rocket airship]].

===={{chap|Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire}}====
A rocket was revealed to have been built there and was awaiting the dimensional shifter, a device developed by [[Devon Corporation]]. It was intended for the rocket to be launched to space and deploy the dimensional shifter towards the [[Grand Meteor Delta|giant meteoroid]] about to collide with the planet, in order to avert a potential apocalypse. [[Professor Cozmo]] and his aides, who confirmed the course of the meteor towards the planet, later helped guard the rocket. {{adv|Sapphire}} was accidentally transported into the rocket by {{p|Hoopa}}, making her the first [[Pokédex holder]] known to have visited the Space Center. She managed to find her way out and deliver the dimensional shifter to Cozmo. Although the rocket was successfully launched, [[Zinnia]] attacked it mid-flight with her {{TP|Zinnia|Salamence}}, and despite Sapphire trying to stop her, made it crash-land and destroyed the dimensional shifter.
