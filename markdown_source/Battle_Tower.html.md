[[File:LaRousse Battle Tower.png|thumb|300px|The [[LaRousse City]] Battle Tower]]
'''Battle Towers''' (Japanese: '''バトルタワー''' ''Battle Tower'') are [[battle facility|special areas]] set up specifically for [[Pokémon battle]]s. Trainers register their Pokémon on the first floor and climb up the floors in a number of battles, fighting other Trainers one by one. There is no penalty for losing other than breaking the player's streak. From [[Generation III]] onward, there are a number of rules that can also be changed within the tower - such as fighting in [[Double Battle]]s{{tt|*|Pokémon Emerald onward}} against the other Trainers. Trainers sometimes battle for bragging rights, but they are often rewarded with rare items or points that can be used to buy rare items as well.

From {{game|Emerald}} onward, Battle Towers are run by {{tc|Tower Tycoon}}s, who fulfill a similar role to that of [[Gym Leader]]s in [[Gym|Pokémon Gyms]]. Trainers taking a Battle Tower challenge have a number of battles in a row, ending after seven wins, or when they lose. The Tower Tycoon may challenge them after certain winning streaks have been made. Initially, the opponents use weak Pokémon and will start using stronger Pokémon the higher the winning streak is. Also, the seventh Trainer may have stronger Pokémon. In some games, opponents may use [[Legendary Pokémon]] after making a certain winning streak. In [[Johto]]{{sup/4|HGSS}}, [[Hoenn]]{{sup/3|E}}, and [[Sinnoh]]{{sup/4|Pt}}, the Battle Tower is part of a larger [[Battle Frontier]]. In the [[Sevii Islands]], a smaller and simplified version of a Battle Tower can be found in [[Trainer Tower]]. [[Pokémon Emerald Version]] also contains the [[Trainer Hill]] facility, which further serves as a modified simplification of the Trainer Tower (despite Emerald housing a Battle Tower of its own within Hoenn's Battle Frontier). While [[Unova]], [[Kalos]], and [[Alola]] do not have Battle Towers, they have similar battle facilities called the [[Battle Subway]], [[Battle Maison]], and [[Battle Tree]], respectively.

Pokémon do not gain [[experience]] in Battle Tower battles, while Trainers are awarded [[Battle Point]]s{{tt|*|Emerald onward, after defeating a set of seven Trainers}} instead of [[Pokémon Dollar|money]]. These points can be redeemed for items, in a shop usually located near the tower. Additionally, Pokémon not registered in the [[Pokédex]] will not be registered upon being seen in a Battle Tower. Pokémon cannot be above the level limit. From [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions]] onward, Pokémon that are above the level range will simply be {{tt|reduced|only if the Pokémon is above level 50}} to level 50 temporarily, the level of the Pokémon that the player will be facing.

===Pokémon Adventures===
In ''[[PS122|Querulous Qwilfish]]'', the Battle Tower in [[Olivine City]] was under construction and was due to be finished in a month. A tank that was collecting waste from the construction cracked under pressure, spilling its contents into the sea nearby and contaminating the water. As a result, {{p|Qwilfish}} attacked a worker and {{adv|Crystal}} out of anger and to protect a baby Qwilfish that became sick due to the pollution. It was also where {{DL|Legendary beasts (Adventures)|Suicune}} first appeared, purifying the water and curing the baby Qwilfish in the process.

In ''[[PS159|Popular Pupitar]]'', {{adv|Silver}} was revealed to have first met [[Lance]] at the Johto Battle Tower construction site, wanting to question him if he knew anything about the {{p|Ho-Oh|giant bird Pokémon}} that the [[Masked Man]] had used to kidnap him nine years earlier.
