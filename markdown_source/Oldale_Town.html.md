'''Oldale Town''' (Japanese: '''{{j|コトキタウン}}''' ''Kotoki Town'') is located in southwestern [[Hoenn]]. As {{wp|Kyushu}} coincides with Hoenn, Oldale approximates with {{wp|Saga, Saga|Saga City, Saga Prefecture}}.

South of Oldale Town is {{rt|101|Hoenn}} and Littleroot Town. North is {{rt|103|Hoenn}}, which can be {{m|Surf}}ed to use as a shortcut to Slateport City. West is {{rt|102|Hoenn}} and Petalburg beyond.

There is little of interest in Oldale Town in the [[Pokémon games]]; the simple town serves as a checkpoint for [[Pokémon Trainer]]s traveling between [[Littleroot Town]] and [[Petalburg City]].

The main character's [[rival]] in [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire Versions|Ruby, Sapphire]], {{v2|Emerald}}, {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire}} ({{ga|Brendan}} or {{ga|May}} depending on the {{player}}'s selected gender) trains to the north of Oldale Town when the games begin.

==Slogan==
'''''Where things start off scarce.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|なにかが　かすかに　はじまる　ところ}}''' ''Where things start off scarce.'')

==Places of interest==
===Tracking scientist===
The way to {{rt|102|Hoenn}} is blocked by a researcher upon the player's first visit to Oldale Town. The scientist is sketching what he believes are footprints from rare Pokémon. Until he is done, west is a no-go. This is to ensure that players challenges their rival on {{rt|103|Hoenn}} and receives a [[Pokédex]] from [[Professor Birch]] before they continue with their journey. When the player returns, the researcher sheepishly stands aside, after concluding that it was his own footprints all along.

===Poké Mart representative===
On the player's first visit, a [[Poké Mart]] worker will stand next to the house on the bottom-right. When talked to, he will lead the player to the town's Poké Mart, and give away a [[Potion]] sample.

==Demographics==
===Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald===
The population of Oldale Town is 16, making it the second-smallest town in [[Hoenn]], with [[Littleroot Town]] being the smallest.

===Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire===
In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Oldale Town has a total population of 14.

==In the anime==
[[File:Oldale Town anime.png|thumb|250px|Oldale Town in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
{{Ash}} and {{an|May}} arrived in Oldale Town in ''[[AG002|A Ruin with a View]]''. There, May dropped off her weakened {{TP|May|Torchic}}, who had a bad confrontation with a family of {{p|Azurill}}, {{p|Marill}}, and {{p|Azumarill}} earlier, at a [[Pokémon Center]]. Later, they met up with [[Professor Alden]] who was studying the nearby [[Oldale Ruins]]. They had a small confrontation with [[Team Magma]], who wanted to explore the ruins for themselves, but they didn't find anything in the ruins and escaped. After that, Ash and May left Oldale and set foot for [[Petalburg City]].

Ash and {{ashfr}} returned to Oldale Town via ship in ''[[AG132|The Scheme Team]]'', following Ash's participation in the [[Ever Grande Conference]]. While none of the town was featured, the group picnicked in a grassy area. Afterwards, they went their separate ways, with Max and May returning to the [[Petalburg Gym]], while Ash and Brock went to [[Littleroot Town]]'s port, where they took a ship to the [[Kanto]] [[region]].

===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Oldale Town appeared in ''[[PS184|Distracting Dustox]]'', where {{adv|Ruby}} passed through it. While trying to think of what to do with his newly-acquired {{p|Mudkip}}, he ended up accidentally angering a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Dustox}}, causing it to attack him. As his other Pokémon were put asleep by Dustox's scales, Ruby was forced to fight it with Mudkip. Mudkip eventually managed to defeat Dustox by soaking it wet, leaving it unable to fly. Impressed by this, Ruby officially added the Mudkip to his [[party|team]] with the [[nickname]] "[[Mumu]]".

==Trivia==
* There's {{DL|List of glitches in Generation III|Poké Mart clerk oversight|a bug}} involving the [[Poké Mart]] clerk in {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}.
