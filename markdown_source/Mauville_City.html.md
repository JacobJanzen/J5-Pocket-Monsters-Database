'''Mauville City''' (Japanese: '''{{j|キンセツシティ}}''' ''Kinsetsu City'') is located in central [[Hoenn]] and serves as the hub for travelers throughout the Hoenn region. The city is also notable for its [[old guys]].

The roads of the town stretch north to {{rt|111|Hoenn}}, west to {{rt|117|Hoenn}} and [[Verdanturf Town]], east to a beach on {{rt|118|Hoenn}}, and south to {{rt|110|Hoenn}}.

[[Wattson]] is the [[Gym Leader]] and founder of Mauville. In {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}, he originally had plans to do a complete overhaul of the town, but abandoned them. In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Wattson instead managed to redevelop it, modeling the design on that of [[Lumiose City]] of [[Kalos]]. Due to this, its layout has changed dramatically, becoming a mostly-indoor city with various shops and floors. The redevelopment of Mauville is the only successful project of [[Greater Mauville Holdings]].

==Slogan==
'''''The bright and shiny city of fun!''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|あかるく　かがやく　たのしい　まち}}''' ''The bright and shiny city of fun.'')

==Places of interest==
===Rydel's Cycles===
{{main|Rydel's Cycles}}
A bike shop is located in Mauville City which is called [[Rydel's Cycles]]. It is very conveniently located for the owner and customers alike, as the [[Seaside Cycling Road]] runs on {{rt|110|Hoenn}}, just to the south. [[Rydel]] sells [[Acro Bike]]s and [[Mach Bike]]s. However, he will give the {{player}} a bike for free after he finds out that the player has come all the way from [[Littleroot Town]] with just [[Running Shoes]]. The player may exchange their bike with Rydel for the other bike.

In [[Generation VI]], after the [[Delta Episode]], the player has the opportunity to carry both bikes at the same time. After advertising the bikes to certain NPCs, the player will receive the counterpart bike of the one they are currently using as thanks for their continued advertisement of the Rydel brand. The NPCs are located:

* {{rt|111|Hoenn}} [[Desert]]: A {{tc|Hex Maniac}} up a muddy slope to the north that requires the Mach Bike to climb.
* {{rt|119|Hoenn}}: A {{tc|Bird Keeper}} at the northmost maze of bridges, requires {{m|Surf}} and {{m|Waterfall}} along with the Acro Bike.
* [[Battle Resort]]: A biking {{tc|Triathlete}} southeast of the [[Pokémon Day Care]].

===Mauville Game Corner===
{{main|Mauville Game Corner}}
Only in [[Generation III]], the [[Mauville Game Corner]] is a tourist attraction where people can gamble coins on slots or roulette. This game corner houses two roulette wheels and sixteen slot machines. A [[Coin Case]] is needed to play at the game corner, which can also be found in one of the houses at Mauville City, in exchange for Harbor Mail.

In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], the Game Corner is closed, with the owner stating that he had to close it for "reasons you don't need to know".
On the closed door, a notice reads:
:''"Thank you for your support over the years. Good game!"''
:''"Mauville Game Corner Owner"''

===Mauville Gym===
{{main|Mauville Gym}}
The Mauville Gym specializes in {{type|Electric}} Pokémon. Wattson, the Gym leader hands out the Dynamo Badge to players who defeat him. The Gym contains electric dividers that turn on or off when different switches are stepped on.

===Vending Machine===
In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], there is a [[Vending Machine]] on the first floor to the east of the {{rt|110|Hoenn}} entrance.

===Mauville Food Court===
{{main|Mauville Food Court}}
In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the Mauville Food Court allows the player places an order for food at one of the three counters. After paying, the player is given an amount of turns to wait for their meal. Taking a seat, the player is then challenged to battle by a gauntlet of Trainers trying to take their seat away.

===Crooner's Café===
In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the bartender at this café will give the player {{TM|48|Round}}.

Outside, a sign reads:
:''"A Mellow Blend of Coffee &amp; Music"''
:''"Crooner's Café"''

===Narcissus Mirror Shop===

Outside, a sign reads:
:''"We See Eye to Eye"''
:''"Narcissus Mirror Shop"''

===Move Tutors===
In {{game|Emerald}}, near Mauville Gym is a man who will teach a compatible Pokémon {{m|Rollout}} one time only.

In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, two [[Move Tutor]]s set up shop in southeastern Mauville. The northern move tutor will teach {{m|Frenzy Plant}}, {{m|Blast Burn}}, or {{m|Hydro Cannon}} to any fully evolved [[starter Pokémon]] that also has maximum [[Friendship]]. The southern move tutor will teach {{m|Grass Pledge}}, {{m|Fire Pledge}}, or {{m|Water Pledge}} to any starter Pokémon.&lt;!-- However, he will refuse to teach if the Pokémon's [[happiness]] does not reach the highest level.-->

Another move tutor can be found in Crooner's Café, who will teach {{p|Keldeo}} and {{p|Meloetta}} their respective [[signature move]]s, {{m|Secret Sword}} and {{m|Relic Song}}.

===Battle Institute Hoenn===
{{main|Battle Institute}}
The Battle Institute on the east side of the first floor works in the same way as the one in Lumiose City in [[Kalos]]. The player can opt for a Battle Test (five consecutive single or double battles) or a Download Test (which can be downloaded either wirelessly or via Wi-Fi at certain time, similar to event Pokémon). The player can win [[Battle Point|Battle Points]] here.

Outside, a sign reads:
:''"Test Your Battle Mettle!"''
:''"Battle Institute Hoenn"''

===Inverse Battle Stop===
{{main|Inver}}
Next to the Battle Institute is the Inverse Battle Stop. Here, the player can battle [[Inver]], the same {{tc|Psychic}} who challenges players to Inverse Battles in Kalos. Inver uses a different pool of Pokémon compared to the ones he used in {{pkmn|X and Y}}, and they start at [[level]] 20 as opposed to level 55. Inver has many preset Pokémon, but only chooses a random three during the battle. In addition, his Pokémon's [[Ability|Abilities]] may vary, even potentially having their Hidden Abilities. After he is defeated, Inver will give the player an item depending on how well they did.

A sign outside the building reads:
:''"Same Old Battles Got You Down? Turn It Up!"''
:''"Inverse Battle Stop"''

Outside the shop, a sign reads:
:''"Massage for Body and Spirit"''
:''"Pokémon Reflexology Services"''

===TV Mauville===
{{main|TV Mauville}}
The TV station that runs the news on the {{DL|PokéNav Plus|BuzzNav}}. The player can sit at the news desk, but this doesn't put them on the BuzzNav news.

===Mauville Hills===
In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the second floor of Mauville City is a high-class apartment complex known as Mauville Hills, and is the only residential area in the city. The player is not authorized to enter until they have agreed to help Wattson investigate [[New Mauville]]. To gain access, the player must speak to Wattson, who can be found in the central area of the city looking at the brightly shining Square Tower after the player has {{pkmn2|caught}} or [[Fainting|defeated]] {{p|Groudon}}{{sup/6|OR}}/{{p|Kyogre}}{{sup/6|AS}}.

All accessible balconies can be {{m|Fly|flown}} or [[Soaring in the sky|soared]] from.

====Apartment 1====
Apt. 1: Rotation Frump's Home is located against the northern wall on the west side of the northern hallway. It is home to a unique female {{tc|Expert}} known as Rotation Girl Circie&amp;mdash;also known as the Rotation Frump, formally known as the Rotation Fiend&amp;mdash;who will reluctantly battle the player in a [[Rotation Battle]] once per day. This is the only instance of Rotation Battles found in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire outside of [[Secret Base]]s and the [[Battle Maison]].

Apt. 2: Ribbon Belle's Home is located against the northern wall on the east side of the northern hallway. It is home to the Ribbon Belle, who will gift the player's entire party with daily {{DL|List of Ribbons in the games|Memorial Ribbons}}.

|}

There is no response from the intercom.

====Apartment 3====
Apt. 3: Old Guys' Home is located against the eastern wall on the north side of the eastern hallway. It is home to the [[old guys]] found in the Mauville City [[Pokémon Center]]. Each time one of the old guys gives the player both of their [[O-Power]]s, they return here (old guys the player has not yet encountered in the Pokémon Center are not present).

If the player speaks to the Storyteller after having spoken to the powerless man in Apt. 11, the Storyteller will ask the player to go fetch the man. When the powerless man is spoken to again, the player will bring him to Apt. 3. Here, the old guys transfer their power to the powerless man one by one, each one disappearing as he does. Once all five old guys have disappeared, the powerless man becomes [[Mr. Bonding]], who gives the player Hatching Power and leaves.

There is no response from the intercom.

====Apartment 7====
Apt. 7: A Dreaming Man's Home is located against the western wall on the south side of the western hallway. It is home to a {{tc|Scientist}} who dreams of giving out {{HM|06|Rock Smash}} to Trainers. He can be found practicing his explanation of the function of Rock Smash HM. On the wall is a picture of a rock being smashed. There is also a {{tc|Beauty}} with a {{p|Slakoth}} in the overworld.

In {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}, the Rock Smash Dude lives in Mauville City and gives out Rock Smash to the player; however, in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, it is instead received from [[Wally]]'s uncle after defeating Wally in front of the [[Mauville Gym]].

There is no response from the intercom.

====Apartment 11====
Apt. 11: A Powerless Man's Home is located against the western wall on the north side of the eastern hallway. It is home to a businessman who is depressed about his lack of power.

This apartment also includes access to the balcony. {{TM|89|U-turn}} can be found on this balcony.

There is no response from the intercom.

====Apartment 13====
Apt. 13: Wattson's Home is located against the northern wall on the east side of the southern hallway. Here, Wattson will request that the player visit [[New Mauville]] and press a button on the computer. After doing so, he will reward the player with {{TM|24|Thunderbolt}}; Wattson will then return to his Gym rather than staying in his apartment. Other than Wattson (who is not always there), inside Wattson's apartment is his wife, as well as a {{p|Plusle}} and {{p|Minun}} walking around in the overworld.

Wattson's apartment also includes access to the balcony. A {{p|Taillow}} in the overworld is standing on this balcony.

Using the intercom, a voice will invite the player inside.

====Apartment 14====
Apt. 14: An Ice-Cream Lover's House is located against the northern wall on the west side of the southern hallway. It is home to a {{tc|Fairy Tale Girl}} who will sell the player a [[Casteliacone]] for {{pdollar}}200 if the player has {{p|Regice}} in their [[party]].

This apartment also includes access to the balcony. A {{tc|Rich Boy}} is standing on this balcony, who comments about the exclusive view tenants have access to.

There is no response from the intercom.

====Inaccessible inhabited apartments====
For all of these apartments, the door is locked, preventing the player from entering; however, a person inside will talk to the player over the intercom.

Apt. 5: A Composer's Home is located against the southern wall on the east side of the southern hallway. Using the intercom, the composer assumes the player to be a fan and considers their presence to be an invasion of his privacy.

Apt. 6: A Devoted Woman's Home is located against the southern wall on the west side of the southern hallway. It is home to woman who is a huge fan of the composer in apartment 5. Using the intercom, the woman assumes the player to be a fan of the composer, criticizing the player for attempting to enter the composer's home and proclaiming that she is a more devoted fan.

Apt. 9: A Cold Woman's Home is located against the southern wall on the west side of the northern hallway. Using the intercom, the woman will simply tell the player she doesn't need anything.

Apt. 10: Home of the Man Who Keeps an Eye on the Corridor is located against the southern wall on the east side of the northern hallway. Using the intercom, the man will ask the player to leave as they are obstructing his view of the corridor through his video intercom.

Apt. 12: A Frightened Man's Home is located against the western wall on the south side of the eastern hallway. It is home to a {{tc|Collector}} who is late on his rent payment. The first time the player visits the area, he is in the hallway being harassed by a loan shark for money, with the two of them entering the locked apartment after a brief conversation. If the player returns to this hallway, the loan shark will be standing outside and give the player a [[Lopunnite]] who took as payment from this tenant. Using the intercom, the man will claim to not be home.

====Vacant apartments====
Apartments 4, 8, 15, and 16 are vacant. There is no response from the intercom. They serve no functional purpose.

Unlike the other three, Apartment 16 states it has a deal on the lease, and using the intercom gives a response of "..." rather than a message telling the player that there is no response.

Apartment 4 is located against the eastern wall on the south side of the eastern hallway, Apartment 8 against the western wall on the north side of the western hallway, Apartment 15 against the eastern wall on the south side of the western hallway, and Apartment 16 against the eastern wall on the north side of the western hallway.

==In the anime==
[[File:Mauville City anime.png|thumb|left|250px|Mauville City in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} first arrived at Mauville in ''[[AG039|A Poké-BLOCK Party!]]'', where they competed in its annual [[Trick House]] contest. Aside from the [[Trick Master|King of Tricks]]' designed obstacles, the group had to deal with {{TRT}} and {{an|Jigglypuff}}'s interventions. In the end, [[Ivan]] won the competition.
[[File:Mauville City anime2.png|thumb|250px|Overlooking view of Mauville City and New Mauville]]
In ''[[AG040|Watt's with Wattson]]'', Ash and his friends went straight to the [[Mauville Gym]] for Ash's third [[Hoenn]] [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}. After getting through the numerous traps set up inside the Gym, Ash challenged [[Wattson]] for a Gym battle. Due to his {{AP|Pikachu}} having accidentally become overcharged while destroying one of Wattson's Gym traps, Ash easily won the match, earning the {{Badge|Dynamo}}. Wattson was initially shaken by his quick loss, and Ash felt that he didn't truly deserve the Badge. However, upon learning the situation behind Ash's swift victory, Wattson told Ash to keep his Badge. Ash and his friends left Mauville City in the [[AG041|next episode]] and headed for [[Fallarbor Town]].

The group returned to Mauville City in ''[[AG059|Manectric Charge]]'', on their way back to [[Petalburg City]]. During their pit stop, Ash decided to have a [[rematch]] with Wattson, using his recently {{pkmn2|caught}} {{AP|Torkoal}}. This time, Wattson emerged victorious in their battle, thanks to his newly [[Evolution|evolved]] {{TP|Wattson|Manectric}}.

In ''[[JN036|Making Battles in the Sand!]]'', Ash and [[Goh]] visited a half-buried Mauville City after reports of a {{weather|sandstorm}}, along with a peculiar song that lured people into it, reached the [[Cerise Laboratory]]. They discovered that a {{p|Flygon}}, which Goh later {{pkmn2|caught}} alongside a {{p|Trapinch}} and {{p|Vibrava}}, was behind the strange phenomenon.

Mauville City is the [[hometown]] of {{ho|Tyson}}, one of Ash's [[rival]]s during the [[Ever Grande Conference]].

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Mauville City appeared in ''[[PS203|I'm Your Biggest Fan, Donphan]]'', where {{adv|Sapphire}} arrived in the outskirts of the city on {{rt|110|Hoenn}}. There, she met [[Wattson]] and the [[Trick Master]], and accidentally found the secret entrance to [[New Mauville]]. In ''[[PS204|Plugging Past Electrike I]]'', the Trick Master revealed that Mauville City was facing a problem with the overpopulation of children, but with the rediscovery of New Mauville, which the Trick Master's ancestor had built as a giant underground amusement park, that problem was solved. As thanks for solving the city's overpopulation problem, Wattson gave Sapphire a {{badge|Dynamo}}.

During the weather crisis caused by {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}} and {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}}, the citizens of Mauville sought shelter in New Mauville.

==Trivia==
* "Mauville" is the French name of [[Violet City]].
** The city's French name "Lavandia" is the same as the German name of [[Lavender Town]].
** Additionally, the city shares its name with [[Lavender Town]] in Korean.
* A small glitch occurs in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}. If the player obtains the Mach Bike or Acro Bike before battling [[Wally]], leaves the city, gets on the bicycle, then re-enters and battles him, the bicycle music will start playing after Wally's theme ends instead of the town's usual background music.
* In the PokéMileage Center shop, there is a TV displaying three pictures. The first one features the [[Lumiose Gym|Prism Tower]], the second one the [[Tower of Mastery]], and the third one the [[Lumiose Museum]].
* In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, after completing the [[Delta Episode]], [[Winona]] is standing on a transmission tower on the roof of Mauville Hills.
