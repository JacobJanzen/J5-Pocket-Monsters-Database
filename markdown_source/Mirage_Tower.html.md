'''Mirage Tower''' (Japanese: '''げんえいのとう''' ''Phantom Tower'') is a location in [[Hoenn]] that only appears in {{game|Emerald}}. It will disappear and reappear in the [[desert]] on {{rt|111|Hoenn}} as the {{player}} visits and leaves the [[Route]]. The tower is four stories tall; the top floor contains a [[Root Fossil]] and a [[Claw Fossil]]. To get to the top, a [[Mach Bike]] and {{m|Rock Smash}} are required. {{pkmn2|Wild}} {{p|Sandshrew}} and {{p|Trapinch}} can be found in the tower.

==Obtaining the Fossil==
Some sections of floor inside are cracked and unstable, so a [[Mach Bike]], which can quickly ride over the weak points before they crumble away, is required to reach the top. After one of the Fossils is taken, the tower will collapse, the remaining Fossil will sink into the sand, and the tower will never return. However, this other Fossil can later be found in the [[Desert Underpass]], the entrance to which is located on {{rt|114|Hoenn}} at the back of the [[Fossil Maniac]]'s house, though it cannot be accessed until the {{player}} completes the game and obtains the [[National Pokédex]].

==Trivia==
* There is a [[List of glitches in Generation III#Mirage Tower collision error|minor error]] on the second floor above the steps; it shows no rock but the player cannot walk there.
* Mirage Tower may be inspired by a tower with the same English name that appears in {{wp|Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy}} for the NES. Both towers appear in a desert, are only visible under certain circumstances, and contain a spiral-shaped interior.
* A {{tc|Backpacker}} found in [[Desert Resort]] in {{game|Black and White|s 2|Pokémon Black 2 and White 2}} makes [[List of cross-generational references|reference]] to the tower, saying, "The Mirage Tower in a desert of the Hoenn region has disappeared."
