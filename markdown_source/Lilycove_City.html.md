'''Lilycove City''' (Japanese: '''{{j|ミナモシティ}}''' ''Minamo City'') is located in eastern [[Hoenn]] and is one of the many cities that is connected to the sea.

Despite Lilycove lacking a [[Gym|Pokémon Gym]], it offers a wide range of attractions. The Hoenn region's [[Department store]], the [[Lilycove Department Store]], is located at the top of the hills offering numerous amounts of supplies for visiting Trainers. Lilycove houses a harbor in which the [[S.S. Tidal]] provides transportation to [[Slateport City]] and the {{Gdis|Battle Frontier|III}}. Lilycove also houses the [[Lilycove Museum]] and the [[Cove Lily Motel]] for tourists to stay in. Finally, it is home to the Move Deleter.

Lilycove is located southeast of {{ci|Fortree}}, near the sea. The western entrance of the city is {{rt|121|Hoenn}}, leading to [[Mt. Pyre]] and the {{safari|Hoenn}}. To the east is {{rt|124|Hoenn}}, the open sea, and either the [[Team Magma]] [[Team Magma Hideout|Hideout]]{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}} or the [[Team Aqua]] [[Team Aqua Hideout|Hideout]]{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}}.

==Slogan==
'''''Where the land ends and the sea begins.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|りくちの　さいはて　うみの　はじまり}}''' ''Where the land ends and the sea begins.'')

==Places of interest==
===Contest Hall===
{{main|Contest Hall}}
[[File:Contest Hall RS.png|thumb|200px|The Lilycove Contest Hall in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}]]
One of the major features in Lilycove is the grand Contest Hall, which, in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, holds the Master Rank [[Pokémon Contest]]s, while in {{game|Emerald}}, all of the Pokémon Contests take place here. It is located in the southern half of the city, south of the [[Pokémon Center]] and west of the Cove Lily Motel. These Contests attract many {{pkmn|Coordinator}}s and {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} from around the country to watch and participate in the events. A lot of citizens are honored to have the hall located right at their doorstep. Inside, there are two reception counters and four [[Berry Blender]]s for making [[Pokéblock]]s. There are also photo frames for winning Pokémon that are painted by a skilled artist. People are also allowed to watch Pokémon Contests as they take place by going their one of two audience entrances.

In {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}, if the player scores high enough while at the same time winning a Master Rank Pokémon Contest, an artist will come and talk to them, saying that he has painted the Pokémon that won. After winning the Master Rank, the painter located in the Contest Hall will then paint the player's Pokémon, and put it on display in the museum. As more paintings are put up, more people come into the museum, eventually prompting the curator to give the aforesaid item.

Contest entries of all ranks are unrestricted in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}.

===Cove Lily Motel===
{{main|Cove Lily Motel}}
[[File:Cove Lily Motel E.png|thumb|200px|The Cove Lily Motel]]
The Cove Lily Motel is a local motel in Lilycove. It is located east of the Contest Hall. Due to the fact that [[Team Magma]] and [[Team Aqua]] were situated in Lilycove City, the city has become an unpopular tourist destination for a time, so the Cove Lily Motel has become empty. However, once the villainous teams were scared away by the player, the [[Game Freak]] staff decided to stay there, and arrive after the player beats the {{pkmn|Champion}}.

The motel has a very simple layout. The lower level only contains a man watching a TV set. If the player attempts to check the TV, they will be shoved away by the man for blocking his view. The upper level contains the Game Freak staff, as it is where they are staying while in Hoenn. Players will find the Graphic Artist, the Programmer, and the Game Designer. The Game Designer will give the player the Poké [[Diploma]] after completing the [[List of Pokémon by Hoenn Pokédex number|Hoenn Pokédex]].

===Lilycove Museum===
{{main|Lilycove Museum}}
[[File:Lilycove Museum Curator RSE.png|thumb|200px|left|Meeting the curator]]
Northern Lilycove is home to the [[Lilycove Museum]], where fine art and paintings are on display. The museum is located west of the Lilycove Department Store and the western-most attraction in town. An art dealer is often seen walking around the entrance. The first floor, or the ground floor as it is known, is the main exhibition floor of the museum; there are many statues here, including a few that are replicas of real statues, as well as a few paintings. Many people wander around this floor for inspiration or to just marvel at the fantastic pieces of artwork. It is this hall that features the classical artwork of Pokémon, and the symbolization of Pokémon, while most artwork originated during the ancient times.

The curator will introduce the second floor to the player as the "special exhibit hall" and tell the player about his future plans for the design. The second floor, as the curator explains, was made for modern and vibrant artwork that features Pokémon springing forth into glorious life, a great change from the first floor which displays classical paintings, and the curator asks the player to search for suitable artwork. At first, there is nothing on this floor. However, if the player wins a Master Rank [[Pokémon Contest]] with at least 800 points, an artist will approach the player saying he's done a painting that might even look good in a museum, at which point the player will direct him to the Lilycove Museum. As more paintings are put up, more people come into the museum, and eventually, if the player accrues five paintings (one for each [[Contest condition|Contest category]]), the curator will be moved by gratitude to give the player a {{DL|Ornament|Glass Ornament}} for their [[Secret Base]].

In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, a {{tc|Kindler}} on the first floor will sell some of his art&amp;mdash;[[Secret Base]] [[decoration]]s&amp;mdash;to the player for {{PDollar}}100,000 each.

===Lilycove Department Store===
{{main|Lilycove Department Store}}
Adjacent to the museum and one of the main attractions of the city is the Lilycove Department Store, the largest store in Hoenn. The receptionist on the left welcomes visitors, and the one on the right gives out Pokémon Loto Tickets for the [[Pokémon Lottery Corner]], with the winning number changing daily. Prizes are awarded for winning numbers, which must match any of the player's Pokémon's [[original Trainer]]'s [[Trainer ID number|ID numbers]] from the last digit to the first one. The second floor is where items to fulfill Trainers' basic needs are available, such as [[Poké Ball]]s, {{cat|Potions}}, [[Mail]], and other [[item]]s. The third floor sells items that raise the [[Statistic|stats]] of Pokémon, while the fourth floor sells four offensive and four defensive [[TM]]s, and the fifth floor sells [[Decoration|furniture]] for [[Secret Base]]s. The rooftop has a couple of [[Vending Machine]]s and hosts a random rooftop sale, which is advertised beforehand. In {{game|Emerald}}, the rooftop also houses a [[Move Tutor]], who will teach a compatible Pokémon {{m|Substitute}} one time only.

===Lilycove City Harbor===
The wharf is a large seaside building located on the southernmost extent of the city's headland, southwest of the [[Contest Hall]]. From here, players may catch the [[S.S. Tidal]] and travel to [[Slateport City]] and either the {{Gdis|Battle Tower|III}} if in {{2v2|Ruby|Sapphire}}, the {{Gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} in {{v2|Emerald}}, or the [[Battle Resort]] in [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]].

In the Generation III games, if the player has one of several [[event item|event-exclusive items]], other locations can also be reached which often contain [[Legendary Pokémon]].

====Vending Machine====
In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], there is a [[Vending Machine]] at the back of the harbor building.

===Pokémon Trainer Fan Club===
{{main|Pokémon Trainer Fan Club}}
[[File:Lilycove Trainer Fan Club E.png|thumb|The Pokémon Trainer Fan Club]]
In Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, the Pokémon Trainer Fan Club is located to the east of the Pokémon Center. Fans at the Pokémon Trainer Fan Club discuss popular [[Pokémon Trainer]]s and [[Gym Leader]]s. Once the {{player}} has entered the [[Hall of Fame]], several members of the fan club announce themselves as fans of the player. In addition to this, and before the completion of the Pokémon League, there will be other members who are fans of some non-player characters including [[Gym Leader]]s such as [[Norman]], [[Elite Four]] members such as [[Glacia]], and {{Steven}}, and also the most recent person to have [[Record mixing|mixed records]] with the player's game cartridge. Winning or losing in Link Battles respectively increases or decreases the number of members who are supporting the player.

===Contest Spectacular Trainer Fan Club===
In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the Contest Spectacular Trainer Fan Club is located to the east of the Pokémon Center. The club is filled with fans of [[Lisia]].

===Move Deleter's house===
{{main|Move Deleter}}
The Move Deleter is located on the northern side of the city, just east of the Lilycove Department Store. He is the only Move Deleter in [[Hoenn]]. Although not a hugely important place to visit, the Move Deleter is helpful for deleting moves that can't be deleted otherwise. He is a very forgetful man, and lives alone. For no charge, the Move Deleter will make a Pokémon forget a [[move]] it knows. This is the only way for a Pokémon to forget [[HM]] moves such as {{m|Cut}} or {{m|Fly}}, besides using the {{pkmn|Day Care}}. In {{v2|Emerald}}, one must have multiple Pokémon knowing {{m|Surf}} in order to delete Surf on one of them. This is done so that a player will not get stuck in an area where Surf is required to continue. In addition, a Pokémon's move will not be forgotten if it is the only move it knows.

===Memory Girl===
{{main|Memory Girl}}
In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, next to the entrance of the Pokémon Center is the Memory Girl, a girl who can read the memories of experiences a Pokémon had with its [[Original Trainer]] (and its most recent owner if it was traded), as well as how the Pokémon felt about the experience. These memories range from meeting the trainer for the first time, defeating wild Pokémon or Gym Leaders, using HMs outside of battle, exploring various locations, evolving, etc. A Pokémon's memory may change over time as it has new experiences with its trainer.

==In the anime==
[[File:Lilycove City anime.png|thumb|left|250px|Lilycove City in the anime]]
In the {{pkmn|anime}}, {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrived in Lilycove City in ''[[AG090|Pokéblock, Stock, and Berry]]''. Originally, they were just passing through the city because it was en route to [[Mossdeep City]], the location of Ash's next [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}. However, after {{an|May}} saw a poster advertising an upcoming [[Pokémon Contest]], scheduled to be held in the city the next day, they decided to stay in Lilycove just so May could compete for her third [[Ribbon]].

After that, the group decided to go grab something to eat to satisfy Ash's hunger, and following May's suggestion, they headed to a restaurant that serves omelets. However, on their way there, {{AP|Pikachu}} wandered off, leading them to a [[Berry]] market where they met a girl by the name of {{ho|Kelly}} and her {{p|Grumpig}}. Kelly revealed that she was planning to enter the Lilycove Contest and she and May bonded over their mutual interest in Pokémon Contests. Kelly then invited May and the others to her home, which is attached to a [[Pokéblock]] shop that [[Otane|her mother]] runs.

[[File:Lilycove Contest poster.png|thumb|220px|A poster for the city's Pokémon Contest showing the Lilycove Ribbon]]
When they arrived there, the group had lunch. Soon after, Ash decided to go out and train for the challenge awaiting him at the [[Mossdeep Gym]]. He was determined to teach {{AP|Swellow}} the [[move]] {{m|Aerial Ace}} and [[Max]] accompanied him. During Ash's {{pkmn|training}} session, an old man known as [[Vladimir|Vladimir the Attacker]] approached Ash and offered to help. Meanwhile, at the shop, May and {{an|Brock}} were learning how to use the [[Berry Blender]] to produce Pokéblocks.

Later, {{TRT}} appeared and tried to steal Kelly's Grumpig. However, May and {{cat|May's Pokémon|her Pokémon}} managed to rescue the {{pkmn|category|Manipulate Pokémon}} before sending [[Jessie]], [[James]], and {{MTR}} blasting off again. The following day at the [[Contest Hall]], [[Vivian Meridian]] opened the Lilycove Contest, welcoming the audience and introducing the three distinguished [[Contest Judge|judges]]: the Chief of the [[Pokémon Activities Committee]], [[Raoul Contesta|Mr. Contesta]]; the [[Pokémon Fan Club Chairman|President]] of the [[Pokémon Fan Club]], [[Mr. Sukizo]]; and the [[Pokémon Center Nurse|operator]] of the local [[Pokémon Center]], [[Nurse Joy]].

With the audience welcomed and the judges introduced, the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]] began and Vivian called the first {{pkmn|Coordinator}} to perform, May. May sent out her {{TP|May|Combusken}}, who despite making a good first impression with its entrance, used {{m|Fire Spin}} in a way that the move seemed to be out of control and risking May's safety. However, as shown in ''[[AG091|Lessons in Lilycove]]'', May was unharmed and Combusken was able to turn the tables and end the performance nicely.

After that, Kelly took the stage and sent out her Grumpig. She proceeded to throw some Pokéblocks, which Grumpig easily manipulated with its {{m|Psychic}} attack. Then on Jessie's turn, she earns a high score thanks to {{TP|James|Chimecho}}'s {{m|Astonish}}. May, Kelly, and Jessie have all successfully secured a place among the talented eight Coordinators advancing to the [[Contest Battle]]s. There, May defeated Jessie in the semifinals and Kelly in the finals, winning her third [[Ribbon]].

In ''[[AG092|Judgment Day!]]'', Ash and his friends left Lilycove City aboard a ship. It was also revealed that Lilycove's ports operate ferry services to [[Bomba Island]] and Mossdeep Island.

In ''[[JN063|On Land, In the Sea, and to the Future!]]'', Ash, [[Goh]], and [[Chloe]] visited Lilycove City to competed in the [[Marine Athletic Race|Kids Marine Athletic Race]].

Lilycove City is the [[hometown]] of {{ho|Katie}}, a [[Pokémon Trainer]] who competed in the [[Ever Grande Conference]]; she is considered to be the pride of Lilycove.

===Pokémon Adventures===

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PS222|Short Shift for Shiftry]]'', the [[Pokémon Association]]'s [[Hoenn]] HQ was revealed to be situated in Lilycove City.

[[TV Mauville|Hoenn TV]] is also housed in Lilycove City. In ''[[PS225|Tanks, but No Tanks, Anorith &amp; Lileep]]'', [[Archie]] was revealed to work as its director, using his influence to keep the public unaware of [[Team Aqua]]'s activities and focus on [[Team Magma]] instead.

In ''[[PS230|Walrein and Camerupt]]'', [[Maxie]] confronted Archie outside Hoenn TV. After a brief {{pkmn|battle}}, they agreed on a temporary truce in between their respective [[villainous team|teams]] so that they could combine their resources and safely reach [[Seafloor Cavern]]. [[Gabby and Ty]] secretly witnessed this, and decided to share the information they had learned with the [[Gym Leader]]s and {{adv|Ruby}}.

In ''[[PS239|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon VII]]'', when the weather crisis struck Hoenn, the Pokémon Association HQ was revealed to have deployed a large balloon and become airborne to escape the ground level devastation.

In ''[[PS245|Bravo, Vibrava]]'', [[Brawly]], [[Roxanne]], and [[Wallace]] were taken to the now-abandoned Lilycove City by the three {{tc|Magma Admin}}s to stop their attempts at halting {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}}'s advancement through Hoenn. Brawly was taken to fight [[Blaise]] in the [[Lilycove Museum]], Roxanne was taken to the [[Cove Lily Motel]] by [[Courtney]], and Wallace faced [[Tabitha]] inside the [[Lilycove Department Store]]. While Brawly and Wallace were able to defeat their opponents, Roxanne was defeated by Courtney as she took hostages and threatened to harm them if Roxanne didn't let herself be defeated. As Roxanne had been using her {{TP|Roxanne|Nosepass}}'s {{m|Block}} to stop Groudon from moving, this defeat allowed Groudon to move on.

In ''[[PS250|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon XII]]'', {{Steven}} joined Wallace in Lilycove City, [[PS251|soon]] followed by the [[Elite Four]]. On the rooftop of the Lilycove Department Store, Steven passed his {{pkmn|Champion}} title on to Wallace.

* The motto of the city is the same motto as that of the city of {{wp|Homer, Alaska|Homer}} in the state of Alaska, In addition, both cities are in a peninsula of their respective areas.
