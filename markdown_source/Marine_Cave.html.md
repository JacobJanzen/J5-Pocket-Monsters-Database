'''Marine Cave''' (Japanese: '''うみのどうくつ''' ''Marine Cave'') is an [[underwater]] cave in [[Hoenn]] that only appears in {{game|Emerald}}.

Unlike most other locations, the location of Marine Cave is not set at all; it can be determined by speaking with a man at Hoenn's [[Weather Institute]], who will explain that one of four [[route]]s is under abnormal weather conditions. If the {{player}} does not reach Marine Cave fast enough, it will temporarily disappear and [[Terra Cave]] will appear. However, once {{p|Groudon}} is defeated/caught in Terra Cave, or if the player did not arrive there fast enough, Marine Cave will reappear and relocate. It appears only on [[water route]]s. In {{game|Emerald}}, it is the only place where {{p|Kyogre}} can be caught. It will only appear once the Hoenn [[Pokémon League]] has been defeated, and it will disappear completely after Kyogre has been either caught or defeated.

Its counterpart is [[Terra Cave]], and the two caves cannot appear at the same time. The player must defeat, catch, or not visit one [[Legendary Pokémon]] before the other cave will appear.
