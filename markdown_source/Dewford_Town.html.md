'''Dewford Town''' (Japanese: '''{{j|ムロタウン}}''' ''Muro Town'') is located on an island southwest of mainland [[Hoenn]]. Dewford houses a dock, providing transportation between {{rt|104|Hoenn}} and {{rt|109|Hoenn}}. The {{player}} can visit this town only after [[Mr. Briney]]'s [[Peeko]] is rescued. The island town is home to [[Brawly]], the Dewford [[Gym Leader]] who specializes in {{type|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Unlike other towns, Dewford does not offer a [[Poké Mart]].

To the north of Dewford Town, on {{rt|106|Hoenn}}, is [[Granite Cave]], a popular spot for rock collectors.

==Slogan==
'''''A tiny island in the blue sea.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|あおい　うみに　うかぶ　ちいさな　しま}}''' ''A tiny island in the blue sea.'')

==Places of interest==
===Dewford Hall===
Dewford Hall is located north of the [[Pokémon Center]], and is the northernmost building in the town. A sign outside reads:

{{sign|E|header}}
{{sign|E|title|DEWFORD HALL}}
{{sign|E|"Everyone's information exchange!"}}
{{sign|E|footer}}

Although it is a tiny island community, if someone says something "[[trend]]y" there, it quickly spreads throughout the rest of Hoenn. Dewford Town is famous for these fads. Trendy phrases are usually passed around in Dewford Hall, called "Everyone's information exchange!" There is a boy just outside Dewford Hall that lets the player change the "trendy" phrase and people in Dewford Hall will be influenced by the trend. Changing this affects where {{p|Feebas}} appears in {{rt|119|Hoenn}}. If the player returns to Dewford Hall after collecting the {{Badge|Balance}}, a dark haired man with glasses will appear near the entrance and proclaim that he loves Sludge Bomb and then he will give the player {{TM|36|Sludge Bomb}}.

===Dewford Gym===
{{main|Dewford Gym}}
Dewford Gym is located in the southernmost portion of Dewford, south of the pier and the Pokémon Center. The sign outside reads:

{{sign|E|header}}
{{sign|E|title|DEWFORD TOWN POKéMON GYM}}
{{sign|E|title|LEADER: BRAWLY}}
{{sign|E|"A big wave in fighting!"}}
{{sign|E|footer}}

The Gym is run by [[Brawly]] who specializes in {{type|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Many citizens look up to [[Brawly]] and idolize him. {{pkmn|Trainer}}s who defeat him receive the {{Badge|Knuckle}}. The Gym is a dark maze in which only little light is given. If the players battle the Gym Trainers, more light is awarded to the player. Once the player defeats [[Brawly]], the Gym is fully illuminated.

==In the anime==
[[File:Dewford Town anime.png|thumb|250px|Dewford Town in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
Dewford Island appeared from ''[[AG019|Sharpedo Attack!]]'' to ''[[AG031|Just One of the Geysers]]''. Its main settlement, Dewford Town, features a three-tiered [[Pokémon Center]] and the [[Dewford Gym]]. {{Ash}} sought to obtain the {{Badge|Knuckle}} from [[Brawly]], but failed in his first attempt in ''[[AG020|Brave the Wave]]''. He remained on the island for a lengthy period of time, which he spent {{pkmn|training}}, and finally defeated the Gym Leader in ''[[AG031|Just One of the Geysers]]''. The rematch took place on Brawly's own practice field, a rocky island connected to Dewford Island by a land bridge revealed during low tide.

In ''[[AG027|A Three Team Scheme!]]'', Dewford Island was revealed to have an ancient shrine, hidden in a cavern and surrounded by water, which both [[Team Magma]] and [[Team Aqua]] initially mistook for the [[Cave of Origin]].

During Ash's training on Dewford Island, [[May's Wurmple]] evolved into {{p|Silcoon}} and eventually {{p|Beautifly}}, he and {{ashfr}} met up with [[Steven Stone]] in [[Granite Cave]], and he {{pkmn2|caught}} a {{AP|Corphish}}, while {{an|Brock}} caught a {{TP|Brock|Mudkip}}. During this time, Ash and his friends also spent some time with [[Professor Birch]].

The island's sandy shores and warm waters make it an ideal surf and fishing spot. However, these same waters are home to sharp rocks and hordes of vicious {{p|Carvanha}} and {{p|Sharpedo}}. It also features many other environments, including forests, lakes, and caves.

Aside from Brawly, Dewford Island's other residents include a Mudkip raiser named [[Old Man Swamp]], [[Keanu]], and {{ho|Shauna}}.

==In the manga==
[[File:Dewford Town Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Dewford Town in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Dewford Town first appeared in ''[[PS191|Blowing Past Nosepass II]]'', with {{Steven}} being informed of the [[Submarine Explorer 1]]'s near-completion as he was heading to investigate [[Granite Cave]].

In ''[[PS193|Stick This in Your Craw, Crawdaunt II]]'', {{adv|Ruby}} and {{adv|Sapphire}} arrived in Dewford Town at the same time, with Ruby sailing aboard [[Mr. Briney]]'s boat and Sapphire riding on her {{p|Wailord}}, Lorry. Both of them then headed to Granite Cave, Ruby to search for a {{p|Milotic}} and Sapphire to train for her match with [[Brawly]]. In ''[[PS195|Mashing Makuhita]]'', Sapphire challenged Brawly at the [[Dewford Gym]], [[PS197|eventually]] emerging victorious and earning herself the {{badge|Knuckle}}. Sapphire soon reunited with Ruby again, who told her how he had met [[Steven Stone]] in the cave. As she was supposed to deliver a [[letter]] from [[Mr. Stone]] to Steven, Sapphire immediately gave chase, dragging Ruby along as well.

In ''[[PS235|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon III]]'', Dewford Town was revealed to have been flooded following {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}}'s awakening.

===={{chap|Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PAORAS00|Omega Alpha Adventure 0]]'', Sapphire and {{adv|Emerald}} were seen in Dewford Town, where Steven had taken them to train [[Mega Evolution]] with [[Ultima]]'s guidance. For the training, he gave them the [[Mega Stone]]s of their respective [[starter Pokémon]], [[Chic|Blaziken]] and {{TP|Emerald|Sceptile}}, in ''[[PAORAS02|Omega Alpha Adventure 2]]''. Once their training was complete, Mr. Stone told them to board the [[S.S. Tidal]] in ''[[PAORAS04|Omega Alpha Adventure 4]]'', and took them to [[Sea Mauville]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Dewford City house map.png|thumb|200px|The fanmade world map]]
* Dewford Town shares similarities with [[Cianwood City]]. Both locations are on an island to the southwest of their respective regions, and neither one has a [[Poké Mart]]. Also, the Gym Leaders of both locations specialize in {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon.
** Additionally, it is one of the three locations in [[Hoenn]] without a Poké Mart; [[Littleroot Town]] and [[Pacifidlog Town]] being the other two.
* In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], there's a calendar in one of the houses that features a popular fanmade map of the [[Pokémon world]].
