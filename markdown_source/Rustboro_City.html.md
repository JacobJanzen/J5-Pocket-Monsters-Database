'''Rustboro City''' (Japanese: '''{{j|カナズミシティ}}''' ''Kanazumi City'') is a metropolis located in western [[Hoenn]]. It is the fourth-largest city in Hoenn, after [[Mauville City]], [[Lilycove City]] and [[Slateport City]]. Rustboro City has an unusual yet unique cityscape in the Hoenn [[region]]. The buildings' architectures are designed with stones, giving it an old-town feeling.

According to the Cutter's daughter, Rustboro was expanded to accommodate its growing size with the help of the Cutter's Pokémon which cleared the trees. The [[Devon Corporation]] is headquartered in the northwest side of the city. The first Gym is located here with [[Roxanne]] as the [[Gym Leader]].

==Slogan==
'''''The city probing the integration of nature and science.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|しぜんと　かがくの　ゆうごうを　ついきゅうする　まち}}''' ''The city probing the integration of nature and science.'')

==Places of interest==
===Devon Corporation===
{{main|Devon Corporation}}
Rustboro serves as the establishment for the [[Devon Corporation]], a company which makes many [[item]]s for [[Pokémon Trainer]]s. The company headquarters is located in the northwest corner of the city, and takes the appearance of a large, old-fashioned looking building. A sign outside reads:

{{sign|E|header}}
{{sign|E|title|DEVON CORPORATION}}
{{sign|E|"For all your living needs, we make}}
{{sign|E|it all."}}
{{sign|E|footer}}

Apart from developing improved and innovative items, the company also revives Pokémon from [[Fossil]]s. The Devon Corporation's workers are also attempting to build impossible machines such as one that can transform people into Pokémon. In the south section of the town is an apartment complex for Devon employees.

===Cutter's house===
A Cutter lives near the [[Pokémon Center]] with his daughter.

When the city of Rustboro was undergoing expansion, the Cutter had his Pokémon use Cut to help clear the land of trees. He will give the {{player}} {{HM|01|Cut}}. According to May/Brendan, he has a younger brother in [[Mauville City]], which is the person that gives out {{HM|06|Rock Smash}} in [[Generation III]].

===Elyssa's house===
Elyssa's House is located next to the [[Gym]] in Rustboro City. By talking to Elyssa, the player is given the option to make an [[in-game trade]]. In {{2v2|Ruby|Sapphire}} and {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Elyssa wants a {{p|Slakoth}}, and will trade a {{p|Makuhita}} named Makit in exchange. Makit is holding an [[X Attack]].

====Kobe's house====
In {{v2|Emerald}}, Elyssa gets replaced by Kobe and he will instead want a {{p|Ralts}} (found on {{rt|102|Hoenn}}), and will trade a {{p|Seedot}} named Dots in exchange. Dots is holding a [[Chesto Berry]].

===Pokémon Trainers' School===
{{main|Pokémon Trainers' School}}
The [[Pokémon Trainers' School]] is located east of the Pokémon Center. A sign outside reads:

{{sign|E|header}}
{{sign|E|title|POKéMON TRAINER'S SCHOOL}}
{{sign|E|"We'll teach you anything about}}
{{sign|E|POKéMON!"}}
{{sign|E|footer}}

Inside are five students and a teacher, who gives the {{player}} the Quick Claw. Talking to the students also reveals helpful information. Behind the teacher is the blackboard with the list of [[status condition]]s ({{status|Poison}}, {{status|Burn}}, {{status|Freeze}}, {{status|Paralysis}}, and {{status|Sleep}}) that may affect Pokémon in a {{pkmn|battle}}. In the anime, [[Roxanne]], the local Gym Leader, runs the school.

===Walda's house===
In {{game|Emerald}}, a sad young girl named [[Walda]] lives between the [[Pokémon Center]] and the [[Devon Corporation]] building. If the proper 'funny' word is given to her caretaker, she will reward the player with a [[Pokémon Storage System#Walda|new wallpaper]] for the [[Pokémon Storage System]].

===Rustboro Gym===
{{main|Rustboro Gym}}
[[Rustboro Gym]] is the first Gym a player must face in the [[Hoenn]] region. It is located in the northern part of Rustboro, east of the Devon Corporation. The sign outside reads:

{{sign|E|header}}
{{sign|E|title|RUSTBORO CITY POKéMON GYM}}
{{sign|E|title|LEADER: ROXANNE}}
{{sign|E|"The ROCK-loving honors student!"}}
{{sign|E|footer}}

The Gym Leader is [[Roxanne]], who specializes in {{type|Rock}} Pokémon. The {{Badge|Stone}} is awarded for defeating Roxanne. The Gym is a maze; there are two paths, one path which battles the Gym Trainers, while the other path lets the players go through without battling.

==Role==
===Delta Episode===
During the [[Delta Episode]], after receiving {{Steven}}'s call in [[Petalburg City]], Steven will be waiting outside the Devon Corporation building in Rustboro City for the player, escorting the player to [[Mr. Stone]]'s office when they arrive.

In his office, Mr. Stone tells the player about the history of the Devon Corporation, then asks the player to retrieve a [[Meteorite Shard]] from [[Granite Cave]]. Throughout the Delta Episode, Mr. Stone mentions where Steven has most recently headed to.

After listening to [[Zinnia]]'s grandmother at [[Meteor Falls]], Steven heads to the Devon Corporation building in Rustboro City. When the player arrives there, a scientist runs out the front door, running away from a Team Magma{{sup/6|OR}}/Aqua{{sup/6|AS}} Grunt. That grunt then challenges the player, followed by a second and third grunt, all of whom run away after their own defeat. After defeating the third grunt, the scientist reveals that the device to control the [[Game Link Cable|Link Cable]] was stolen by [[Courtney]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Matt]]{{sup/6|AS}} and that Steven has headed off to the [[Mossdeep Space Center]].

==Demographics==
===Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire===
In {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, the population of Rustboro City is 57, making it the third largest city in [[Hoenn]], behind [[Lilycove City]] and [[Slateport City]].

===Pokémon Emerald===
In {{game|Emerald}}, the population of Rustboro City is 61, making it the second largest city in Hoenn, behind [[Lilycove City]], which has over twice the population of Rustboro.

===Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire===

==In the anime==
[[File:Rustboro City anime2.png|thumb|left|250px|Rustboro City in ''[[Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire]]'']]
Rustboro City debuted in ''[[AG013|All Things Bright and Beautifly!]]''. {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrived at [[Contest Hall|Rustboro Hall]], located in its southern outskirts, and discovered that a [[Pokémon Contest]] was scheduled to take place there in just a few hours. They were surprised by the way contestants prepared their {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} for the event, as it was very different from how {{pkmn|Trainer}}s usually {{pkmn|training|train}} their Pokémon for Gym matches. After a meeting with [[Janet]] and {{an|Chaz}}, two skilled [[Pokémon Coordinator]]s, they learned about the proceedings of the competition and decided to enter. However, the lady in the registration desk was not accepting new entries as the event had already reached the maximum number of contestants allowed. Nonetheless, they received [[Contest Pass]]es and watched the Pokémon Contest get underway, with {{an|May}} and [[Max]] working as Janet's assistants.
[[File:Rustboro Ribbon.png|thumb|220px|The Rustboro Ribbon]]
During the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]], Chaz had his {{p|Venomoth}} showing off its {{m|Confusion}} attack, while Janet had her {{p|Beautifly}} using {{m|String Shot}} to break plates thrown by May and Max. Their performances impressed the [[Contest Judge|panel of judges]] enough to secure them a place in the second round. Jessie's performance, on the other hand, was a total failure as she commanded her newly {{pkmn2|caught}} {{TP|Jessie|Seviper}} to use several [[move]]s it didn't known. In the [[Contest Battle]]s, both Janet and Chaz defeated their opponents to reach the finals. The two had a close battle, but when time ran out Janet was shown to have more points. As a result, she was declared the winner of the Rustboro Contest, earning her third [[Ribbon]]. Throughout the competition, May was amazed by the performances and the different kind of battling, and this inspired her to become a Pokémon Coordinator.

In ''[[AG015|Gonna Rule The School!]]'', {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} attended the [[Pokémon Trainers' School]] and first met [[Roxanne]], the [[Rustboro Gym]] Leader and Trainers' School headmistress. [[Max]] spent much of his time with {{OBP|Tommy|AG015}}, {{OBP|Kenny|AG015}}, and [[Anita]]. Later, all Beginner Class students, and helped defeat {{TRT}}.

In ''[[AG016|The Winner by a Nosepass]]'', Ash battled Roxanne and earned himself the {{Badge|Stone}}. The match was filmed by some of Roxanne's students to become a learning resource at the Rustboro Trainers' School.

In ''[[AG017|Stairway to Devon]]'', Max spilled soda on the [[PokéNav]], causing it to malfunction. While attempting to avoid {{an|May}} so she wouldn't find out, Max bumped into [[Mr. Stone]], who agreed to fix the PokéNav and take him on a guided tour through this company, the [[Devon Corporation]]. During the tour, Mr. Stone and Max spotted a mysterious scientist, later revealed to be a {{tc|Team Aqua Grunt}}, who stole two capsules from the [[Fossil]] restoration lab. The thief was eventually cornered by Mr.Stone, Ash, and his friends, with Team Rocket inadvertently causing the grunt to lose the stolen goods. While the thief managed to escape, Max was able to recover the tubes for Mr. Stone.
[[File:Rustboro City anime.png|thumb|250px|Rustboro City in ''[[Pokémon the Series: XY]]'']]
In ''[[AG018|On a Wingull and a Prayer!]]'', Ash and his friends visited the desolate harbor of Rustboro City to take a boat to [[Dewford Town]]. After missing the morning service boat, the group decided to wait for the afternoon ferry. During that time, the group re-encountered the Team Aqua Grunt from the Devon Corporation heist, who hoped to take [[Mr. Briney]]'s boat and make his getaway. The grunt took Mr. Briney's {{p|Wingull}}, [[nickname]]d [[Peeko]], as a hostage. While Mr. Briney recovered Peeko using his other boat, the S.S. Wingull, the grunt escaped with Mr. Briney's boat. Afterwards, he was recovered by his fellow grunts, who were waiting out at sea with a submarine. As a reward for their assistance, Mr. Briney escorted Ash and his friends to Dewford Island.

After a long absence, Rustboro City appeared again in ''[[XYS03|Mega Evolution Special III]]'', where [[Alain]], [[Mairin]], and {{Steven}} arrived there, following the energy signature of the [[Giant Rock|giant rock]] they had [[XYS02|previously]] encountered. [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] [[Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)#Groudon|Groudon]] and Primal [[Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)#Kyogre|Kyogre]] also followed the energy, and clashed with each other just off the coast of Rustboro City. The battle was eventually stopped by [[Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)#Rayquaza|Rayquaza]], although the giant rock was taken away by [[Lysandre]]'s submarine to be studied at [[Lysandre Labs]].

Much of Rustboro City is tall buildings and thriving, but its seaport and the neighboring suburb appear derelict. In ''On a Wingull and a Prayer!'', May was particularly disappointed to learn that the famous "Rustboro City Pasta" restaurant was closed up. Rustboro's coastline is largely open water, with sharp rocks like Triangle Rock further out.

Rustboro City appeared in ''[[SP19|Trust In Each Other!!]]'', where {{Ash}}, like in the {{pkmn|anime}}, took on and defeated [[Roxanne]] at the [[Rustboro Gym]].

===Pokémon Adventures===
Rustboro City first appeared in ''[[PS190|Blowing Past Nosepass I]]'', where {{adv|Sapphire}} arrived there in order to challenge the [[Rustboro Gym]]. After passing the exam required to challenge the [[Gym Leader]], Sapphire was allowed to challenge [[Roxanne]]. After emerging victorious and earning the {{badge|Stone}}, Sapphire headed to [[Dewford Town]] by sea on the back of her {{p|Wailord}} in ''[[PS192|Stick This in Your Craw, Crawdaunt I]]''.

===Pokémon Pocket Monsters===
Rustboro City appeared in ''[[PMRS06|Extra Heavyweight Battle]]'', where {{OBP|Red|Pocket Monsters}} and his Pokémon visited [[Pokémon Trainers' School]].

==Trivia==
* As Hoenn coincides with {{wp|Kyushu}}, Rustboro coincides approximately with {{wp|Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka}} and {{wp|Kitakyushu}}.
* Rustboro City is very similar to [[Saffron City]] of [[Kanto]] and [[Jubilife City]] of [[Sinnoh]]. All three cities are home to their region's corporate giants.
** It is also similar to [[Pewter City]] of Kanto and [[Goldenrod City]] of Johto. Their geographic locations to their regions are very remarkably similar, as well as being only accessible through a forest during the beginning of the games. Rustboro is more like Pewter in that both cities are the second city visited with a Gym, but first to be beaten by the {{player}}. Both Pewter and Rustboro's Gyms specialize in {{type|Rock}} Pokémon, and play a role in the player obtaining Fossil Pokémon.
* In {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, there is an {{wp|Easter egg (media)|Easter egg}} findable in Rustboro City, involving the {{tc|Ace Trainer}} who gives the {{player}} a [[Float Stone]]. After giving it to the player, he will explain its effect of halving the holder's weight. If the player then leaves and re-enters the floor, the Ace Trainer has turned into a {{tc|Hiker}}, who tells that he has put on a lot of weight recently for some reason.
