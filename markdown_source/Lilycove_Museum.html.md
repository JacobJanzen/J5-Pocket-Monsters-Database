The '''Lilycove Museum''' (Japanese: '''ミナモ{{tt|美術館|びじゅつかん}}''' ''Minamo Art Gallery'') is an art museum in [[Lilycove City]]. The museum features a collection of fantastic artwork featuring Pokémon and {{pkmn|Contest}}s. Most of the exhibits on the first floor are classical statues and sculptures featuring or symbolizing Pokémon, while the second floor is home to modern and vibrant artworks of Pokémon. Unlike the [[Oceanic Museum|museum]] of [[Slateport City]], the {{player}} is not charged a fee upon entrance.

==Structure==
===First floor===
The ground floor is the main exhibition floor of the museum; there are many statues here as well as a few paintings. Many people wander around this floor for inspiration or to just marvel at the fantastic pieces of artwork. It is this hall that features the classical artwork of Pokémon and the symbolization of Pokémon, where most of the artwork originated during ancient times.

On entry to the Lilycove Museum, the information desk can be located on the western side. Here the receptionist will explain that the first floor features a collection of fantastic artwork. Further west is the southwestern hall. In {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}, a woman and her child can be found marveling over a piece of artwork that includes a painting of a beautiful, smiling woman with a Pokémon on her lap. Also in this hall is a painting of {{type|grass}} Pokémon swaying in the breeze, enjoying the wind's gentle caress. In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the two paintings that were here have been moved to the east wing. Pamphlets and two small pieces of art are now on the wall. A {{tc|Kindler}} will sell some of his art&amp;mdash;[[Secret Base]] [[decoration]]s&amp;mdash;to the player for {{PDollar}}100,000 each.

The northwestern hall hosts four paintings. The painting on the far east displays an odd landscape with a bizarre and fantastic scenery, which in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire shows {{p|Giratina}}. To its right are a delicious-looking painting of {{Berries}} and a very old painting that has its canvas peeled here and there. The last painting in the northwestern hall shows a vase in Generation III and a [[Pokémon Trainer]] and his {{p|Altaria}} in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.

By traveling along east, the eastern hall can be found hosting several Pokémon statues. An artist can be found searching for inspiration from the artworks in the museum, while another student can be found expressing his love for the fine arts.

Featured in this hall is a huge stone tablet inscribed with Pokémon and a dense text in the small characters of an ancient, unreadable language, which could possibly be {{p|Unown}} writing. A sculpture that depicts an ancient bird Pokémon resembling {{p|Pidgeot}} is also located here. Next to it is a large {{i|Poké Ball}} carved from a black stone, apparently used in festivals in the olden days. There is also a painting located on the northern wall that displays the [[Mythical Pokémon]] {{p|Arceus}}, painted from the artist's imagination. In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, a {{p|Shroomish}} sculpture created by an up-and-coming artist is also exhibited along with paintings of a {{p|Ralts}} and a {{p|Roselia}} on the back wall.

In Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, the stairs to the second floor are also located in this hallway; however, they are blocked by the curator until the player is willing to help him complete the second floor's painting collection. In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the staircase is instead located in the center of the back wall, directly in front of the entrance.

===Second floor===
[[File:Lilycove Museum Curator RSE.png|thumb|200px|Meeting the curator]]
The curator will introduce the second floor to the player as the "special exhibit hall" and tell the player about his future plans for the design. The second floor, as the curator explains, was made for modern and vibrant artwork that features Pokémon springing forth into glorious life, a great change from the first floor which displays classical paintings. The curator asks the player to search for suitable artwork.

At first, there is nothing on this floor. However, in {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}, if the player wins a Master Rank [[Pokémon Contest]] with at least 800 points, an artist will approach the player saying he's done a painting that might even look good in a museum, at which point the player will direct him to the Lilycove Museum. If the player accrues five paintings, one for each [[Contest condition|Contest category]], the curator will give the player a {{DL|Ornament|Glass Ornament}} for their [[Secret Base]]. In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], each category has three frames, one of which will be filled each time the player wins a Master Rank Contest. Once all frames have been filled, the curator will give the player the Glass Ornament if talked to.

===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
The Lilycove Museum appeared in ''[[PS247|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon IX]]'' and ''[[PS248|X]]'' as the setting for a battle between [[Brawly]] and [[Blaise]]. Brawly was initially intimidated by Blaises's illusions when the paintings came to life, but eventually defeated Blaise using techniques he acquired from [[Bruno]] during a training camp.

Two paintings were featured in this chapter: the painting of Grass-type Pokémon and the painting of a beautiful, smiling woman.
