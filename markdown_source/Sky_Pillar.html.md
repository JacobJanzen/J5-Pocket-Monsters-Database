The '''Sky Pillar''' (Japanese: '''{{tt|空の柱|そらのはしら}}''' ''Sky Pillar'') is a building in [[Hoenn]]. It is located on the northern edge of {{rt|131|Hoenn}} in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, {{game|Emerald}}, and {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}. {{p|Rayquaza}} appears at the top of the Sky Pillar.

It includes the tower itself, as well as a cave with no wild encounters that is directly connected to Route 131. In the Generation III games, the land on top of the island the Sky Pillar is located on, which is traversed after exiting the cave but before entering the tower, is a part of the Sky Pillar; in the Generation VI games, this area is instead part of Route 131.

In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the Sky Pillar does not appear on the [[Town Map]] until the {{player}} enters the cave, and cannot be {{m|Fly|flown}} to until the player enters the tower. Additionally, the tower is not visible while [[soaring in the sky]], but the island and the cave are and can be flown to.

Only those who are worthy, such as the [[Draconid people]] and the descendants of the original Sootopolitans, are permitted to enter the Sky Pillar.

==Role==
In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, the island on which Sky Pillar is located is blocked off by walls of rocks until the player enters the [[Hall of Fame]]. In Pokémon Emerald, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the player can access the land in front of the Sky Pillar immediately, but cannot enter the cave in front of Sky Pillar until reaching a certain point in the storyline.

In Pokémon Emerald, during the conflict in [[Sootopolis City]] between {{p|Groudon}} and {{p|Kyogre}}, [[Wallace]] and the player travel to Sky Pillar, where Wallace unlocks the door, in order to allow the player to meet {{p|Rayquaza}} at the top. Due to being accessed earlier, the wild Pokémon are at lower levels, and during this visit only, less of the floor is cracked such that the player does not need a [[Mach Bike]] to reach the top floor.

In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the entrance is blocked off by a {{tc|Furisode Girl}} until Wallace removes the seal during the [[Delta Episode]]. He will not do so until the player asks for his help while he is admiring the great tree in [[Sootopolis City]] in front of the [[Cave of Origin]]. If the player did not catch {{p|Deoxys}} at the edge of space during the [[Delta Episode]], after entering the [[Hall of Fame]] again, Deoxys can be encountered at the summit of the Sky Pillar, along with its triangular shard.

===Delta Episode===
During the [[Delta Episode]], after the player asks for Wallace's help while he is admiring the great tree in [[Sootopolis City]] in front of the [[Cave of Origin]], he will open the seal to the Sky Pillar on Route 131. However, he does not allow the player to enter until the player defeats him again.

While climbing the tower, [[Zinnia]] will tell the player the player about the history of the [[Draconid people]]. At the summit, she summons Rayquaza by using the [[Key Stone]]s she gathered. She then tries to have it Mega Evolve using her Mega Anklet, but Rayquaza is unable. Rayquaza tells Zinnia that it is not a lack of the human energy from Key Stones that is preventing it from Mega Evolving, but its own lack of energy. The [[Meteorite]] in the player's [[Bag]] then begins to glow, alerting Zinnia to its presence, who explains that it has the same kind of energy as [[Mega Stone]]s. Rayquaza then eats the Meteorite from the player's Bag.

With Rayquaza having regained its power, the player must capture Rayquaza to take control of it and save the world; if the player [[escape|runs away]], defeats Rayquaza or is defeated, Rayquaza will remain and be ready for battle again fully healed (its [[Nature]] and {{IV}}s reset each time). If the player has no [[Poké Ball]]s, Zinnia will give the player an [[Ultra Ball]].

After the player successfully captures Rayquaza, they must place it in their party; if they have six Pokémon, they must send one to the [[PC]]. Then, Zinnia restores the player's Pokémon to full health and teaches Rayquaza {{m|Dragon Ascent}}, replacing {{m|Fly}}. She then challenges the player to a battle to prove their worthiness.

Regardless of the outcome of the battle with Zinnia, the player then puts on the [[Magma Suit]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Aqua Suit]]{{sup/6|AS}} and rides Mega Rayquaza to the edge of space. Mega Rayquaza flies right through the [[Grand Meteor Delta|meteoroid]], shattering it completely. However, one triangular piece remains, from which {{p|Deoxys}} emerges. It then charges at the player and Rayquaza in rage. After the battle with Deoxys, the player returns to the planet, having thwarted the danger imposed by the asteroid.

==Geography==
In [[Generation III]] (except the player's first visit in Emerald), {{player}}s must have the [[Mach Bike]] in order to navigate through it fully, as there are [[Hole#Generation III|cracked tiles]] on 2F and 4F. On every other floor, there are wild Pokémon, such that only floors without cracked tiles contain wild Pokémon.

In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, while there are many holes in the floor and cracks in the floor tiles, the player cannot fall down; the player does not need the Mach Bike, and in fact cannot cycle at all inside the tower. The tower contains a series of ladders which must be climbed to reach the summit. An extremely tall mural painted by the [[Draconid people]] that stretches the height of the tower tells the tale of Rayquaza halting the fight between [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] {{p|Groudon}} and {{p|Kyogre}} and the first [[Mega Evolution]]. The Draconid people call the top of the tower the Dragonhark altar.

==In the manga==
[[File:Sky Pillar Adventures.png|thumb|200px|Sky Pillar in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
The Sky Pillar is a 50-floor-tall tower with a variety of [[wild Pokémon]] living inside. The 50th floor is a large puzzle that requires the combined efforts of an adult and child to solve it, where the adult pulls on levers that open a tunnel big enough for the child to move through. Those that solve the puzzle will gain access to the room where {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Rayquaza}} sleeps.

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
The Sky Pillar first appeared in ''[[PS241|Dreadful Dealing with Dusclops]]''. {{adv|Wally}} was taken there by [[Norman]] in order to find and awaken Rayquaza. After traversing its floors and solving the puzzle with Norman, Wally succeeded in the given task. Norman then took Rayquaza to try and stop the battle between {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}} and {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}} in [[Sootopolis City]].

===={{chap|Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PAORAS02|Omega Alpha Adventure 2]]'', {{adv|Ruby}} and {{DL|Eon duo (Adventures)|Latios}} traveled to the Sky Pillar by [[Soaring in the sky|soaring]] through the skies. There, they encountered [[Zinnia]], who attacked the two under the impression that they were intruding. During the battle, Ruby recognized [[Zinnia's Salamence]] as the same {{p|Salamence}} that had attacked him and {{adv|Sapphire}} when they were little. After Zinnia had left, Ruby stayed at the tower to examine all the 50 floors and take photos of the giant mural inside before leaving as well.

==Trivia==
* In Generation III, when stopping the [[bicycle]] on a certain section of cracked floor tiles on the second floor, it is possible to fall on top of a rock. However, it is possible to walk off the rock, so there is no risk of being stuck there.
* In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the Sky Pillar theme is a remix of the song that plays in Emerald when Rayquaza arrives to stop Groudon and Kyogre's fight in Sootopolis City.
* In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, even if Deoxys is caught during the [[Delta Episode]], its met location will still be listed as Sky Pillar.
* In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the [[Memory Girl]] in [[Lilycove City]] will refer to Rayquaza and Deoxys's met location as "the inside of a tall building," despite the fact that these Pokémon aren't encountered inside the tower.
