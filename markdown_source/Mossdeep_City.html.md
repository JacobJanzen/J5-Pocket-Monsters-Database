'''Mossdeep City''' (Japanese: '''{{j|トクサネシティ}}''' ''Tokusane City'') lies on an island along the eastern edge of the [[Hoenn]] mainland. Many divers live at Mossdeep, and it is the fourth largest city in Hoenn. One of the city's attractions is {{p|Wailmer}} watching. A deep [[underwater]] trench runs between Mossdeep City and [[Sootopolis City]]. This cavern was found by [[Captain Stern]] in his [[Submarine Explorer 1|submarine]]. Mossdeep City has a [[Gym|Pokémon Gym]] whose [[Gym Leader]]s are [[Tate and Liza]].

The island of Mossdeep is covered in plants and flowers. Its weather is mainly sunny, and its winds are stable. This clear weather made Mossdeep the ideal location to build a space center to launch large rockets. In Mossdeep, there is a white rock which holds a special meaning to the people at the space center. They placed the rock outside of the space center as a symbol of their wish for their rockets to fly safely. After entering the [[Hall of Fame]], the {{player}} can obtain a [[level]] 5{{sup/3|RSE}}/1{{sup/6|ORAS}} {{p|Beldum}} from {{Steven}}'s house.

Mossdeep City is the hub area of [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]]'s [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Pokémon Alpha Sapphire Special Demo Version|Special Demo Version]].

North of Mossdeep is the [[Shoal Cave]], on {{rt|125|Hoenn}}. To the west is {{rt|124|Hoenn}}, and {{rt|127|Hoenn}} lies to the south.

==Slogan==
'''''Our slogan: Cherish Pokémon!''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|「ポケモンを　たいせつに！」が　あいことば}}''' ''Our slogan: "Cherish Pokémon!"'')

==Places of interest==
===Mossdeep Space Center===
{{main|Mossdeep Space Center}}
Mossdeep was the ideal location to build a space center which launches huge rockets because of the stable weather conditions. The Space Center is successfully sending rockets into space. In {{v2|Emerald}}, the Space Center plays a big part in the plot, where [[Team Magma]] attempts to steal rocket fuel while a rocket begins to launch into space. On the second floor, the player will meet with Steven and battle two {{tc|Team Magma Grunt}}s.

The Space Center also plays a key role in the Delta Episode of {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}. A {{p|Kecleon}} hides behind the astronaut cut out on the bottom floor in after the Delta Episode. This {{p|Kecleon}} has its hidden ability {{a|Protean}}.

===Steven's house===
The possibility of rare stones in the cavern has attracted the attention of [[Steven Stone]], who owns a cottage here where he keeps part of his rock collection. He will leave behind a rare {{p|Beldum}} after the player enters the [[Hall of Fame]]. Steven will also give the player [[HM08]] here in {{2v2|Ruby|Sapphire}} ([[HM07]] in their [[remake]]s, both containing {{m|Dive}}). In {{v2|Emerald}}, however, he will give the player HM08 after defeating [[Team Magma]] at the [[Mossdeep Space Center|Space Center]]. In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], Steven's collection includes hornblende biotite granite from [[Rock Tunnel]], pitchstone from [[Mt. Mortar]], chert from [[Mt. Pyre]], schalstein from [[Mt. Coronet]] and greenschist from [[Chargestone Cave]].

===Secret Base boy===
The house west of the Pokémon Center houses a brother and sister. The boy likes to visit people's [[Secret Base]]s.

In Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, the boy will tell the player where their [[Secret Base]] is located.

In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the boy tells the player that they can access additional areas in Secret Bases with [[Ornament#Other|Stairs]] and [[Solid Board]]s.

===Pokéblock enthusiast's house===
The house north of the Pokémon Center houses a couple. The man is a {{tc|Black Belt}} who is very enthusiastic about [[Pokéblock]]s.

In Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, he will tell the player the preferred [[flavor|color]] of Pokéblock of the player's lead Pokémon.

In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, he serves no purpose, simply telling the player that their lead Pokémon likes them more than Pokéblocks.&lt;!--he is not a friendship checker-->

===Backdoor house===
In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, these is an old man with a house with a door on the back wall.

In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, [[e-Reader]] Trainers will appear in the back room.

In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the old man mentions he used to be a Secret Base Expert. If the player scans the QR Code of a special [[Secret Base]] (such as those of [[Junichi Masuda]], [[Shigeru Ohmori]], [[Shigeki Morimoto]], and [[Shōko Nakagawa]]), it will appear behind this door.

===Game Corner===
A Game Corner is located here in {{game|Emerald}}. It replaces the backdoor house from {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}. It allows players to interact with {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} and other copies of Emerald in two mini-games, [[Pokémon Jump]] and [[Dodrio Berry Picking]]. Connections are made with the [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter]].

===Running Errands===
Visit the house nearest the stairway to the Space Center to meet a young woman who uses a {{p|Wingull}} to send letters to a friend in [[Fortree City]]. Talk to the Wingull and it will take flight, off to deliver another note. If the player return to Fortree and visit the Pokémon Breeder in the northeast house there, it will get a [[Mental Herb]] that his Wingull found in its travels.

===Move Tutor===
In {{game|Emerald}}, there is a {{tc|Black Belt}} on the shore in the western part of the city who will [[Move Tutor|teach]] a compatible Pokémon {{m|Dynamic Punch|DynamicPunch}} one time only.

===Mossdeep Gym===
{{main|Mossdeep Gym}}
The Mossdeep Gym is Mossdeep City's official [[Gym|Pokémon Gym]], which specializes in {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon. Its [[Gym Leader|Leaders]] are [[Tate and Liza]], who are faced in a [[Double Battle]]. Defeating them earns the player the {{badge|Mind}} and {{TM|04|Calm Mind}}.

==In the anime==
[[File:Mossdeep City anime.png|thumb|250px|Mossdeep City in the {{pkmn|anime}}]]
===Main series===
{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrived in Mossdeep City in ''[[AG099|It's Still Rocket Roll to Me!]]'' and immediately found the [[Mossdeep Gym]]. However, it was temporarily closed due to a space shuttle launch, so the group followed {{an|Rachel}} to the [[Mossdeep Space Center]], where they met up with the local [[Gym Leader]]s, Rachel's twin children [[Tate and Liza]]. The two groups worked together to foil {{TRT}}'s plan to steal the space shuttle.

In ''[[AG100|Solid as a Solrock]]'', Ash battled Tate and Liza and won, claiming his seventh [[Hoenn League]] [[Badge]].

In ''[[SM145|Dreams of the Sun and Moon!]]'', {{an|Sophocles}} mentioned that he had plans to visit Mossdeep City and the Mossdeep Space Center with [[Molayne]] during the upcoming vacation. They departed for said vacation in [[SM146|the next episode]]. In ''[[JN037|That New Old Gang of Mine!]]'', Sophocles was revealed to have returned to [[Alola]] from his trip, although he was planning to visit the Space Center again in the future.

According to the anime, Mossdeep City is located on Mossdeep Island. As mentioned in ''[[AG092|Judgment Day!]]'' and ''[[AG093|Clamperl of Wisdom]]'', ferry services run between Mossdeep and some of its neighboring islands, as well as [[Lilycove City]].

===Pokémon Generations===
[[File:Mossdeep City PG.png|thumb|250px|Mossdeep City in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]
Mossdeep City made a couple of brief background appearances during ''[[PG08|The Cavern]]''. It also briefly appeared in ''[[PG09|The Scoop]]'', with the episode's focus being mainly on the Mossdeep Space Center.
{{-}}

==In the manga==
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire}}====
Mossdeep City was the setting of two flashbacks. In the first flashback, {{Steven}} arranged a meeting in his house with {{adv|Ruby}} and {{adv|Emerald}}, where the two learned about a meteor's impending impact with their planet. After telling the two about his father's plan and their awareness of opposition to it, Steven also gave Ruby and Emerald a [[Mega Bracelet]] each, as well as an additional Mega Bracelet to pass to Sapphire. In the second flashback, Ruby and Emerald were at the Mossdeep coastline after their meeting with Steven. Ruby then used [[Courtney]]'s memory lighter to investigate Steven's potential enemy.

==Trivia==
* As with the rest of [[Hoenn]], Mossdeep City is based on a real location in Japan, specifically the island of {{wp|Tanegashima}}. {{wp|Tanegashima Space Center}}, {{wp|JAXA}}'s main launch facility, is the basis for the [[Mossdeep Space Center]].
