The '''Desert Underpass''' (Japanese: '''さばくのちかどう''' ''Desert Underground Tunnel'') is a long tunnel located behind the [[Fossil Maniac]]'s house on {{rt|114|Hoenn}} in [[Hoenn]]. The passage is found only in {{game|Emerald}} and is only open to {{pkmn|Trainer}}s who have entered the [[Hall of Fame]]. A few species of [[wild Pokémon]] can be found in the tunnel, with the area's main attractions being wild {{p|Ditto}} for {{pkmn|breeding}} (which cannot be found anywhere else in the game), and the [[Fossil]] that was not selected in the [[Mirage Tower]] earlier in the game.

From its entrance on Route 114, the Desert Underpass extends eastward through the mountains of northern Hoenn, passing north of [[Fallarbor Town]] and {{rt|113|Hoenn}} before terminating in a sand-filled {{wp|cul-de-sac}}. In the center of the cul-de-sac is the Fossil that was not picked in the Mirage Tower.
