'''Devon Corporation''' (Japanese: '''デボンコーポレーション''' ''Devon Corporation'') is a large company that is based in [[Rustboro City]] in [[Hoenn]]. Most of the locals just shorten the name to "Devon". It was a small company that mined rocks and smelted iron sand to iron many years ago, but has grown by leaps and bounds, and even rivals [[Kanto]]'s [[Silph Co.]] The Devon Corporation is headquartered in a large stone building in the northern section of town.

Devon makes many useful products, most of which are geared towards Pokémon training. The company is responsible for creating the new types of Poké Balls found in Hoenn.

The Devon Corporation also developed a process to revive Pokémon from [[Fossil]]s. It is unknown if this process was developed independently from the [[Cinnabar Island]] and [[Sinnoh]] region research laboratories.

The current president of the Devon Corporation is [[Mr. Stone]].

===Pokémon Producer===
[[File:Devon Pokémon Producer.png|220px|thumb|The amazing Pokémon Producer machine]]

This machine allows an extinct {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} to be brought back to life from DNA preserved in a [[Fossil|Pokémon Fossil]]. It has five capsules that are filled with an orange liquid called ''Creation Fluid''. When a Pokémon Fossil is placed inside the fluid, the machine extracts its data, which is analyzed by a high-powered supercomputer. The result is a blueprint for the Pokémon; from this blueprint, the corporation grows a regenerated Pokémon.

In the anime, the Pokémon Producer is still a work in progress, but is fully functional in the games.

==In the games==
The {{player}} can bring [[Fossil]]s to a scientist located on the second floor to get them restored. Engineers on the second floor are working on developing devices that allow people to talk to {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}, as well as one that visually reproduces the dreams of {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}; in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, this scientist also mentions that his [[Fennel|rival]] who lives [[Unova|far away]] is working on a similar project.

According to a {{tc|Scientist}} in the [[Team Magma Hideout]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Team Aqua Hideout]]{{sup/6|AS}}, [[Tabitha]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Shelly]]{{sup/6|AS}} used to work for Devon Corporation.

The Devon Corporation was previously run by Mr. Stone's grandfather, who decided to use the [[Infinity Energy]] of the [[ultimate weapon]] in order to help people and Pokémon. The [[Devon Parts]] were parts for a submarine that would allow it to be powered by Infinity Energy. The rockets launched from the [[Mossdeep Space Center]] use Infinity Energy through Devon technology, as well.

===Role===
The player's first encounter with Devon Corporation occurs in [[Petalburg Woods]], where a Devon researcher claims to be looking for wild {{p|Shroomish}}. The researcher is then attacked by a member of [[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}} or [[Team Aqua]]{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}}, whom the player must battle in order to prevent the [[Devon Parts|Devon Goods]]{{sup/3|RSE}}/[[Devon Parts]]{{sup/6|ORAS}} from being stolen.

After defeating [[Roxanne]], the same researcher can be seen chasing after a [[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}} or [[Team Aqua]]{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}} thief who has managed to steal the Devon Goods/Devon Parts from him. After pursuing the thief into [[Rusturf Tunnel]] and defeating him and returning the Devon Goods/Devon Parts to the researcher, the player will automatically be taken to the 3F of the Devon Corporation building (which was previously inaccessible). Here, [[Mr. Stone]], the company president, asks the player deliver the Devon Goods/Devon Parts to [[Captain Stern]] in [[Slateport City]] and a [[Letter]] for {{Steven}} in [[Granite Cave]]. In return for accepting these favors, Mr. Stone presents the player with a [[PokéNav]], or in [[Generation VI]] a BuzzNav enhancement for the player's [[PokéNav Plus]]. In [[Generation III]] only, after delivering the Letter, the player will also receive an [[Exp. Share]] upon speaking to Mr. Stone again. Additionally, the researcher will stand outside of Rusturf Tunnel and give the player a [[Repeat Ball]] after delivering the Devon Goods/Devon Parts.

In {{game|Emerald}}, a researcher will install the {{DL|PokéNav|Match Call}} feature onto the player's [[PokéNav]] when exiting the building after talking to [[Mr. Stone]] for the first time. The player will then be prompted to call Mr. Stone who explains the feature in brief detail and claims that the player seems quite happy as he is watching from a window in his 3F office.

In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, bringing the [[Intriguing Stone]] to Mr. Stone will reveal that it is really [[Pidgeotite]], which the player will then receive.

====Delta Episode====
During the [[Delta Episode]], after receiving {{Steven}}'s call in [[Petalburg City]], Steven will be waiting outside the Devon Corporation building in [[Rustboro City]] for the player, escorting the player to [[Mr. Stone]]'s office when they arrive.

In his office, Mr. Stone tells the player about the history of the Devon Corporation and asks the player to retrieve a [[Meteorite Shard]] from [[Granite Cave]]. Throughout the Delta Episode, Mr. Stone mentions where Steven has most recently headed.

After listening to [[Zinnia]]'s grandmother at [[Meteor Falls]], Steven heads to the Devon Corporation building in Rustboro City. When the player arrives there, a scientist runs out the door, running away from a Team Aqua Grunt. That grunt then challenges the player, followed by a second and third grunt, all of whom run away after they are defeated. The scientist then reveals that the device to control the [[Link Cable]] was stolen by [[Courtney]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Matt]]{{sup/6|AS}} and that Steven has headed off to the [[Mossdeep Space Center]].

==In the anime==
[[File:Devon Corporation anime.png|thumb|250px|Devon Corporation in [[Pokémon the Series: XY]]]]
[[Max]] visited the Devon Corporation in ''[[AG017|Stairway to Devon]]'', after he has spilled a drink onto the [[PokéNav]], causing it to malfunction. He first learned of the Corporation after stumbling across an inventor, who later revealed himself to be its President, [[Mr. Stone]].

Upon arriving, Max asked to have the device fixed, but the reception admitted that the Corporation did not handle repair servicing. Mr. Stone then discovered Max hiding behind a pillar and took him up to the lab, where he gave the broken PokéNav to the scientists and showed Max four unfinished inventions - one that creates a visual projection of Pokémon dreams, one that allows [[human]]s to speak with {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}, one that allows humans to become Pokémon, and a machine that brings extinct Pokémon back to life from [[Fossil]]s.

Max then asked Mr. Stone if {{Ash}}, {{an|May}}, and {{an|Brock}} could come and visit the company and Mr. Stone sent his assistant [[Kennedy]] out to fetch them. Mr. Stone noticed an intruder in the lab, and then started following him with Max. Soon after May and the others arrived, it was announced that some of the Creation Fluid used to regenerate Pokémon from Fossils was missing. Mr. Stone and Max confronted the culprit, a {{tc|Team Aqua Grunt}}, on the rooftop.  After a battle with Ash, the intruder [[recall]]ed his Crawdaunt and tried to escape. However, the [[Team Rocket trio]], who had also tried to infiltrate the Corporation, leaped onto him in an attempt to grab whatever he had stolen for themselves. With a {{m|Thunderbolt}} from {{AP|Pikachu}} Team Rocket were blasted off, and dropped the Creation Fluid in the process, which Max caught. The intruder made a clean getaway and escaped [[Officer Jenny]] in ''[[AG018|On a Wingull and a Prayer]]''.

In ''[[XYS03|Mega Evolution Special III]]'', [[Steven Stone]] brought [[Alain]] and [[Mairin]] to the Devon Corporation headquarters to analyze the situation of the missing [[Giant Rock]]. There, they received a conference call from [[Lysandre]] that [[Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)#Groudon|Groudon]] and [[Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)#Kyogre|Kyogre]] had undergone [[Primal Reversion]] and were set to collide in the middle of the ocean. After the crisis had been solved, Steven, Alain and Mairin returned to Devon Corporation before leaving for the [[Kalos]] [[region]] to learn more about the Giant Rock.

==In the manga==
{{incomplete|section|Image from Pokémon Adventures}}
===Pokémon Adventures===
Like in the games, Devon is a corporation that manufactures technology for the general public and is run by [[Mr. Stone]].

====Prior to {{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
In the past, Devon was rivals with [[Greater Mauville Holdings]] before the latter was shut down.

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Mr. Stone worked with [[Captain Stern]] to create a heart component for the [[Submarine Explorer 1]]. This component was created to allow the submarine to withstand the pressure of the deep sea. With these machines, Mr. Stone planned to have the [[Seafloor Cavern]] sealed in order to prevent evil hands from awakening the super-ancient Pokémon {{p|Kyogre}} and {{p|Groudon}}. The heart component was later stolen by Team Aqua and the Submarine Explorer 1 was taken by Team Magma. The event of being robbed by Team Aqua caused Mr. Stone to fall into a coma. Before falling unconscious, he gave {{adv|Sapphire}} a letter meant to be given to his son, Steven. The letter is later revealed to contain missing parts of a stone slat that contained the secrets in awakening the [[legendary titans]]. When Steven received the letter, he used it to awaken {{p|Regirock}}, {{p|Regice}}, and {{p|Registeel}} in order to try and contain the energy released by Kyogre and Groudon when they clashed.

===={{chap|Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire}}====
[[File:Devon Corporation PMRS.png|thumb|200px|Devon Corporation in [[Pokémon Ruby-Sapphire]]]]
The corporation was informed by [[Professor Cozmo]] that a large meteoroid would crash into the planet and destroy it. To prevent this crisis, Devon worked with the Mossdeep Space Center to construct a rocket that would be used to stop the meteoroid. After receiving a warning letter from [[Zinnia]] to stop using their technology, Mr. Stone and Steven enlisted the help of the Hoenn [[Pokédex holder]]s, {{adv|Ruby}}, {{adv|Sapphire}} and {{adv|Emerald}} to fight against the enemy. Additionally, they provided the three with [[Mega Bracelet]]s and training from [[Ultima]] in order to fully master the ultimate moves. Once finished, Mr. Stone took Sapphire and Emerald to the [[Sea Mauville]], where they used a machine known as the [[ultimate weapon|Absorber]] that can drain the life energy of Sapphire's [[Chic]] and Emerald's {{TP|Emerald|Sceptile}} in order to power a dimensional shifter capable of transporting the meteoroid to somewhere else when outfitted to the rocket.

Although the area was attacked by Zinnia in order to prevent Devon's plan from succeeding, the dimensional shifter managed to reach Mossdeep City safely. After being informed of the situation, Mr. Stone and Steven headed to Mosseep to assist with the launch of the rocket. Zinnia later attacked the rocket while it was in the process of launching. Although Sapphire attempted to stop her, Zinnia won the battle and destroyed both the shifter and the rocket.

===Pokémon Ruby-Sapphire===
Devon Corporation appeared in ''[[PMRS07|Let's Invite Something New! Go! Go! Go!]]''.

==Trivia==
* The Pokémon Transformer may be a reference to [[Bill]]'s machine that turned him into a Pokémon.
* The scientist working for the Devon Corporation in {{3v2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}} is working on a machine to visualize the dreams of Pokémon, but says he is not succeeding. Likewise, in the anime, Devon is trying to construct a Dream Visualizer. Both of these are apparently precursors to the {{g|Dream World}}, a feature in [[Generation V]]. In addition, in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the scientist also mentions that his [[Fennel|rival]], [[Unova|who lives far away]], is also working on the project.
* In the anime, the Devon Corporation building resembles {{wp|Toronto City Hall}}.
* Devon Corporation is named after the {{wp|Counties of England|English county}} of {{wp|Devon}}. The reason to adopt Devon seems to be related to the {{wp|Devonian}} geologic period.
