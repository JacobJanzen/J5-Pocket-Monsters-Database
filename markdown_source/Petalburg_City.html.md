'''Petalburg City''' (Japanese: '''{{j|トウカシティ}}''' ''Touka City'') is located in southwestern [[Hoenn]]. Despite Petalburg being the first city with a [[Gym]], the Gym is not accessible until after obtaining four [[Badge]]s. [[Norman]], the father of the {{player}}s, is also the Petalburg [[Gym Leader]].

East of Petalburg City is {{rt|102|Hoenn}} and [[Oldale Town]]. To the west is {{rt|104|Hoenn}} where [[Mr. Briney]]'s Cottage and the [[Petalburg Woods]] are found.

When a player first arrives at this city, they are prevented from heading out into Route 104 until they go to the Gym and talk to Norman. A boy named [[Wally]] will come in asking for help to catch a Pokémon. Using {{p|Zigzagoon}}, a Pokémon Norman lends, and the player's support, Wally catches his first Pokémon: a {{p|Ralts}}.

In Generation III, the [[Pokémon Center]] has a man near the PC who will let players put key words on their {{ga|Trainer Card}}s.

==Slogan==
'''''Where people mingle with nature.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|しぜんと　ひとが　ふれあう　まち}}''' ''The city where people mingle with nature.'')

==Places of interest==
===Wally's house===
Wally's house is located in the west section of the town, next door to the Gym. Wally, the main rival of Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, and his family live here. It cannot be visited until after the player has helped Wally catch a Pokémon. After defeating [[Petalburg Gym]], Wally's family will give the player {{HM|03|Surf}}.

===Petalburg Gym===
{{main|Petalburg Gym}}
The Petalburg Gym is the official [[Gym]] of Petalburg City.  It is based on {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. The [[Gym Leader]] is [[Norman]]. Norman is the father of the {{player}} in {{3v2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}, and {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}. He uses Normal Pokémon and gives out the {{Badge|Balance}}. Between the entrance and Gym Leader Norman are a series of rooms, each containing a Trainer. The Trainers have special ways to battle, as displayed on the doors leading to their rooms. Once three rooms in a row are completed, they can access the Gym Leader Room with Norman. When defeated, Norman will give the player the Balance Badge as well as {{TM|42|Facade}}{{sup/3|RSE}} or {{TM|67|Retaliate}}{{sup/6|ORAS}} as a reward.

==Role==
===Delta Episode===
During the [[Delta Episode]], after [[Zinnia]] has stolen the neighbor {{ga|Brendan}}/{{ga|May}}'s [[Mega Bracelet]] from them in their house, [[Courtney]]{{sup/6|OR}}/[[Matt]]{{sup/6|AS}} is here trying to steal [[Wally]]'s [[Key Stone]] from him outside his house, despite Wally insisting he doesn't have it anymore. Upon seeing the player, the villainous team admin decides to battle the player in order to take their Key Stone instead. Upon defeating villainous team admin, they say they are going to head to [[Meteor Falls]].

After the battle, the player receives an Entry Call on their [[PokéNav Plus]] from {{Steven}}, and requests that the player meet him at the [[Devon Corporation]] in [[Rustboro City]] to discuss some urgent business.

==In the anime==
[[File:Petalburg City anime.png|thumb|250px|Petalburg City in the anime]]
In the {{pkmn|anime}}, Petalburg City is the [[hometown]] of [[Norman]] and [[Caroline]], and their children {{an|May}} and [[Max]]. It has a sister city to the north of it, called [[North Petalburg]], where the citizens are obsessed with Norman and his family.

{{Ash}} and May first arrived there in ''[[AG003|There's no Place Like Hoenn]]''. After meeting up with May's family and having an unofficial {{pkmn|battle}} at the [[Petalburg Gym|local Gym]], which Norman won, Ash left together with May and Max. They returned to Petalburg City in ''[[AG069|Love, Petalburg Style!]]'', where they had a confrontation with {{TRT}}. Ash had an official Gym battle with Norman in the [[AG070|following episode]]. He was successful in defeating Norman this time, earning the {{Badge|Balance}}.

May and Max returned home in ''[[AG132|The Scheme Team]]'', following May's participation in the [[Hoenn Grand Festival]] and Ash's efforts in the [[Ever Grande Conference]]. By ''[[AG133|The Right Place and the Right Mime]]'', both May and Max had left home again to rejoin Ash in the [[Kanto]] [[region]]. However, May left behind her {{TP|May|Beautifly}} and {{TP|May|Skitty}} to keep her mother company.

==In the manga==
[[File:Petalburg City Adventures.png|thumb|220px|Petalburg City in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PS185|Nixing Nuzleaf]]'', {{adv|Ruby}} arrived in Petalburg City. After defeating a group of [[wild Pokémon]] trying to attack him, he discovered {{adv|Wally}}, whose attempts to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} one of them had caused them to be startled. Ruby offered to help him catch a Pokémon, but Wally told him that someone else was already coming to help him do that. Said person turned out to be [[Norman]], much to Ruby's horror, as he was trying to avoid his father after running away from home to participate in [[Pokémon Contest]]s. Wally asked Norman to teach him how to catch Pokémon, but Norman refused, since he hadn't been informed of Wally's illness before he had made his promise.

In ''[[PS186|Brushing Past Breloom]]'', after Ruby had escaped his father's detection and taken Wally back home, Wally told him that his parents didn't want him to catch a Pokémon, so they must've told Norman to refuse helping him. Angered by this, Ruby took Wally to [[Petalburg Woods]] to teach him how to catch himself a Pokémon.

In ''[[PS188|Lombre Larceny]]'', {{adv|Sapphire}} helped to free [[Mr. Stone]]'s {{p|Castform}} after it had gotten stuck in a fountain in Petalburg City. [[Team Aqua]] {{tc|Aqua Admin|Admins}}, who had sabotaged the fountain on purpose in order to secretly steal the [[Devon Parts]] Mr. Stone was carrying while "saving" Castform, decided to abandon secrecy and directly attacked Mr. Stone, escaping with the parts while Sapphire pursued them to Petalburg Woods.

==Trivia==
* In {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}} and {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, a woman says that [[Norman]] (and indirectly the rest of his family, which includes {{ga|Brendan}} or {{ga|May}}) moved to [[Hoenn]] from the [[Johto]] region. This reference was removed in {{game|Emerald}}, with the lady instead saying that he came from "somewhere far away".
** Norman himself also states that he is from [[Olivine City]] at the [[Pokémon World Tournament]] in {{game|Black and White|s 2|Pokémon Black 2 and White 2}}.
* In the {{smw|Mario}} game ''{{smw|Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door}}'', there is a town also named {{smw|Petalburg}} in English; however, its Japanese name is different. Additionally, there is a {{smw|Sun Stone}} and a {{smw|Moon Stone}} near said town.
