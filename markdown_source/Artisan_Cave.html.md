'''Artisan Cave''' (Japanese: '''アトリエのあな''' ''{{wp|Atelier}} Hole'') is a long cave connecting one end of the {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} to the other. The entrance is near the [[Battle Palace]] and the exit is right next to the {{gdis|Battle Tower|III}}. It only appears in {{game|Emerald}}.

==Geography==
The cave is two floors high, contains several [[vitamin]]s, and the only [[wild Pokémon]] found inside is {{p|Smeargle}}. This is the only area in the [[Generation III]] [[core series]] {{pkmn|games}} (other than via the unused [[Altering Cave]] event) where the {{player}} can find Smeargle.

===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Emerald}}====
Artisan Cave appeared from ''[[PS314|A Sketchy Smattering of Smeargle]]'' to ''[[PS316|Skirting Around Surskit II]]'', where {{adv|Emerald}}, [[Todd Snap]], and all of the [[Frontier Brain]]s, save for [[Noland]], went there to investigate if {{adv|Jirachi}} was there. As soon as they entered the cave, they were surrounded by a herd of wild {{p|Smeargle}} that attacked them; however, Emerald ignored them. Soon Emerald found Jirachi. However, when he tried to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} it with a [[Timer Ball]], [[Guile Hideout]] showed up and sliced the [[Poké Ball]] in half with his sword, intending to catch Jirachi for himself. Following {{adv|Crystal}}'s instructions, Emerald chose to ignore Guile and focus on catching Jirachi. However, Guile then sent out all the [[rental Pokémon]] he had stolen from the {{gdis|Battle Factory|III}} to attack everyone, revealing the he was the one who had attacked Noland earlier.

Angered by this, [[Spenser]], [[Brandon]], [[Tucker]], and [[Lucy]] attacked Guile Hideout, but he easily reflected all of their Pokémon's [[move|attacks]] right back at them with his sword without getting even scratched. While [[Greta]] used her {{p|Umbreon}}'s {{m|Double Team}} to distract the rental Pokémon, [[Anabel]] used her {{DL|Legendary beasts (Adventures)|Raikou}}'s {{m|Thunder Shock}} to trap Guile in an electrical cage, leaving Emerald alone to focus on catching Jirachi without distractions. After weakening Jirachi using Crystal's [[Bonee]] and [[Monlee]], he attempted to catch it with a [[Luxury Ball]]. Although Jirachi went into the Poké Ball, Guile Hideout used his {{p|Surskit}}'s {{m|Psybeam}} to prevent the ball from closing and then destroy it. He then broke free from the electrical cage and tried to attack everyone with his sword, but [[Emerald's Sceptile]], {{TP|Emerald|Sudowoodo}}, and {{TP|Emerald|Dusclops}} protected them. When Guile tried to snatch Jirachi, it disappeared, and he left the cave to continue pursuing it.

In ''[[PS324|A Cheeky Charizard Change-Up II]]'', Noland revealed that he had visited the cave and caught three Smeargle living there, due to them having {{m|Sketch}}ed Jirachi's {{m|Wish}}, which he hoped to use to find Jirachi before Guile.
