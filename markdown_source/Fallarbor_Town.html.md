'''Fallarbor Town''' (Japanese: '''{{j|ハジツゲタウン}}''' ''Hazitsuge Town'') is a small farming community in northwest [[Hoenn]]. It is extremely close to [[Mt. Chimney]], so much that the ash from the volcano constantly falls near the town.

To the west of the town is {{rt|114|Hoenn}} and the [[Fossil Maniac]]'s house, and to the east is {{rt|113|Hoenn}}. In the fields of Fallarbor, the locals plant seedlings of hardy trees that thrive even in volcanic ash.

==Slogan==
'''''A farm community with small gardens.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|ちいさな　はたけが　ある　のうそん}}''' ''A farm community with small gardens.'')

==In the anime==
[[File:Fallarbor Town anime.png|thumb|220px|Fallarbor Town in the anime]]
In the {{pkmn|anime}}, {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrived in Fallarbor Town in ''[[AG050|Pros and Con Artists]]'', where they met {{ho|Grace}}, a skilled [[Pokémon Coordinator]] with three [[Ribbon]]s already under her belt. At first, {{an|May}} was excited for her second [[Pokémon Contest]] and confident that she would win. However, she became nervous after seeing just how experienced Grace was.

[[File:May Beautifly Fallarbor Contest.png|thumb|left|220px|May and her Beautifly]]
Noticing this, Grace decided to show May one of her [[Contest combination|combinations]]. She sent out her {{p|Medicham}} and asked it to show off its [[move]]s, impressing May who had never considered combining attacks before. This inspired May to {{pkmn|training|practice}} with her {{TP|May|Beautifly}}, but she could not decided which moves would work well together and Beautifly ended up getting tangled in its own {{m|String Shot}}.

To make matters worse, her [[rival]] [[Drew]] appeared during her training session and criticized her for being so indecisive. He also revealed that he had already won three Contest Ribbons. Later, Drew challenged Ash to a [[Pokémon battle]]. Despite being at a type disadvantage, his {{TP|Drew|Roselia}} managed to defeat [[Ash's Taillow]] by {{status|paralyzing}} it with {{m|Stun Spore}} and then attacking with a powerful {{m|Solar Beam}}. Having watched the battle, May became even more nervous and feared she would not win the competition.

In ''[[AG051|Come What May!]]'', May, Grace, Drew, and [[Jessie|Jessica]] all competed in the Fallarbor Town Pokémon Contest. For the [[Appeal|first round]], May had Beautifly spinning while using {{m|Silver Wind}}, a performance that placed her among the four Coordinators advancing to the [[Contest Battle]]s. There, she defeated Jessica to reach the final round, where she found herself up against Grace. The two fought a hard battle, with Grace's Medicham using Beautifly's String Shot to its own advantage and encasing Beautifly in ice with an {{m|Ice Punch}}. However, May was able to lend a few direct hits and use some effective combinations, eventually winning the match and obtaining her very first Ribbon.

===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
{{spoilers}}
Fallarbor Town appeared in ''[[PS223|I More Than Like You, Luvdisc I]]'' where {{adv|Ruby}}, [[Gabby and Ty|Gabby, and Ty]] traveled there by the [[TV Mauville|Hoenn TV]] car. Although Gabby and Ty initially served to transport Ruby during his quest for the [[Pokémon Contest]] [[Ribbon]]s, during their visit, they realized that [[Professor Cozmo]], who lived in Fallarbor Town, could hold the answers they sought. They decided to interview Cozmo, only to see that Cozmo was not at his lab. His three aides confirmed the disruption of the balance between land and sea after [[Team Aqua]] had ended the volcanic activity at [[Mt. Chimney]], and were awaiting [[Wallace]] who had made a visit to Fallarbor to discuss the findings.

Meanwhile, Ruby participated in Pokémon Contests at the Fallarbor [[Contest Hall]], and saw Wallace for the first time as he aimed to complete the [[Rank (Contest)|Super Rank]] set of Ribbons. Out of jealousy, he challenged Wallace to an impromptu Contest, only to lose. Ruby then offered to be a student of Wallace, promising to win the Super Rank {{OBP|Beautiful|condition|Beauty}} Contest to be seen as worthy. Once Wallace arrived at Cozmo's lab, the three aides revealed that the information they collected had not been broadcasted to the public. Gabby phoned [[Archie|her boss]] for an explanation, and he suggested that such a broadcast could spread fear and panic. Gabby and Ty thus set off for [[Lilycove City]] for more answers while Ruby followed Wallace to the Hoenn [[Gym Leader]]s' emergency meeting at [[Fortree City]].
