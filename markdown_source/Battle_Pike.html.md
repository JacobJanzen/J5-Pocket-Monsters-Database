The '''Battle Pike''' (Japanese: '''バトルチューブ''' ''Battle Tube'') is a [[Battle facility|facility]] within the [[Hoenn]] {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} in {{game|Emerald}}. The structure is a long pike in the design of a {{p|Seviper}}.

==Challenges==
The player is challenged to make it through seven rooms, but before each one they are given a choice of three rooms to enter. In any room, one of the following eight events may occur:
* '''Single Battle''': A Trainer with 3 Pokémon walks up to the player and battles.
* '''Double Battle''': Two Trainers with 1 Pokémon each will team up and battle the player. This room will not appear if the player already has two fainted Pokémon.
* '''Hard Single Battle and healing''': The player has to face a "somewhat tough Trainer" in a Single Battle with 3 Pokémon. This is a battle with a higher-tier opponent than those corresponding to the current pass. If the player wins the battle, the entire party is completely healed as a reward.
* '''Wild Pokémon''': Wild Pokémon appear as the player crosses a long corridor.
* '''No event''': An NPC stands to the side of the room but does nothing.
* '''Status condition''': A {{tc|Gentleman}}'s {{p|Kirlia}} or {{p|Dusclops}} will supposedly use a move, attempting to inflict a [[status condition]] on some number of the player's non-fainted Pokémon that do not already have a status condition (one random Pokémon in the first five passes, two in the sixth through tenth passes, or all three in later passes), with the Gentleman blaming this on his Pokémon's Timid [[Nature]]. If the randomly chosen Pokémon has a type or Ability that matches an immunity to the status in the chart below, the status will not be inflicted, but the attempt will still be used up. Note that {{type|Electric}} Pokémon are immune to receiving paralysis this way, although they did not normally become immune to either {{m|Thunder Wave}} or paralysis in general until [[Generation VI]].

|}

* '''One or two recovery''': A Gentleman will fully heal either one or two of the player's Pokémon.
* '''Full recovery''': A receptionist will fully heal all three of the player's Pokémon.

The player cannot change the initial order of their party during a challenge, but {{cat|Moves usable outside of battle|moves with field effects}} can still be used. Held items used or stolen during battle will be lost until the player either wins or loses the current challenge. Likewise, the player's Pokémon are allowed to keep items stolen from opponents until the end of the current challenge.

In the area where the player must pick one of the three paths, there are two receptionist ladies. The one standing by the entrance of the room will tell the player which room they are currently at, and will also allow the player to suspend their challenge to continue later. The lady standing by the three pathways at the top will name one room and give a hint as to what it contains. Each quote has two possibilities. The other two paths will yield a random result, but cannot be one of the rooms that would match the hint.

If all of the player's Pokémon are either fainted or afflicted with a status condition already, the status condition room will never appear. If the player does not have at least two non-fainted Pokémon, the Double Battle room will never appear.

[[File:Battle Pike battlefield.png|thumb||250px|The Battle Pike's battlefield in the anime]]
The Battle Pike appeared in ''[[AG158|Queen of the Serpentine!]]''. In the anime, it is located near [[Fuchsia City]] and was the fourth {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}} facility challenged by {{Ash}}. {{ashfr|The group}} discovered its location in ''[[AG154|Reversing the Charges]]'', following Ash's victory against [[Tucker]] at the [[Battle Dome]]. The facility is run by [[Lucy]] and her assistants, one of whom is named [[Barbara]]. One of these assistants [[Battle judge|referees]] the battles against Lucy.

The Battle Pike has a battlefield with both land and water portions, allowing aquatic Pokémon, such as Lucy's {{p|Milotic}}, to battle effectively as well. In the Battle Pike, challengers have to defeat the Pike Queen in two consecutive {{pkmn|battle|Single Battles}}. Using his {{AP|Donphan}} and {{AP|Pikachu}}, Ash was able to defeat Lucy, earning the [[Symbol|Luck Symbol]], his fourth Frontier Symbol.

===Pokémon used in the Battle Pike===
The following is a list of {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} used in the Battle Pike:
{{TrainerPoké
|main=yes
|trainer=Lucy
|pkmn=Seviper
|type1=Poison
|img=Lucy Seviper.png
|epnum=AG158
|epname=Queen of the Serpentine!
|vajp=Megumi Hayashibara
|vaen=Bill Rogers
|desc=Lucy's signature Pokémon is {{p|Seviper}}. It appeared for the first time fighting [[Jessie's Seviper]] and later battled [[Ash's Donphan]], defeating the former and losing to the latter.}}

{{TrainerPoké
|trainer=Lucy
|pkmn=Milotic
|type1=Water
|img=Lucy Milotic.png
|epnum=AG158
|epname=Queen of the Serpentine!
|vajp=Chie Satō
|vaen=Michele Knotz
|desc={{p|Milotic}} was Lucy's second choice after defeating Seviper. It was able to defeat Ash's Donphan with a single {{m|Hydro Pump}}. In the fight against Ash's Pikachu, Milotic managed to deal severe damage to Pikachu, but Pikachu won after using {{m|Volt Tackle}} in one of Milotic's {{m|Twister}}s.

Milotic's known moves are {{m|Hydro Pump}}, {{m|Twister}}, {{m|Iron Tail}}, and {{m|Facade}}.}}

==In the manga==

[[File:Battle Pike Adventures.png|thumb|230px|The Battle Pike in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
[[File:Battle Pike CBF.png|thumb|200px|The Battle Pike in [[Pokémon Battle Frontier]]]]
===Ash &amp; Pikachu===
The Battle Pike appeared in ''[[SP36|An Infinite Bond!!]]'', where Ash battled and defeated Lucy there, just like in the anime.

===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Emerald}}====
The Battle Pike first appeared in ''[[PS308|As Luck Would Have It, Kirlia]]'', where {{adv|Emerald}} challenged it as his second Battle Frontier challenge during the Battle Frontier's seven-day opening ceremony. Using a team of Pokémon he had borrowed from {{adv|Crystal}}, Emerald eventually made it to the 140th room, where Lucy was located, and begun battling her. Although he seemed to be at a tight spot by the end of the {{pkmn|battle}}, he managed to make a comeback and defeat Lucy, earning him the [[Symbol|Luck Symbol]].

After the battle, rather than exiting through the back door, Emerald chose to take the long way back through the rooms he had traveled through during his challenge. Accompanied by [[Todd Snap]], he met {{DL|Eon duo (Adventures)|Latias}}, who had disguised herself as one of the Battle Pike maids in order to secretly support him. Using his special mud pellets, Emerald calmed down a group of [[wild Pokémon]] that had been about to go berserk before exiting the facility, including a {{TP|Emerald|Dusclops}}, which would later start following him.

===Pokémon Battle Frontier===
The Battle Pike appeared in ''[[CBF5|The Predestined Battle!]]'', where {{OBP|Enta|CBF}} challenged the facility, eventually facing Lucy. His {{p|Zangoose}}, which he had caught shortly before entering the Batte Frontier, was full of anger, especially in the face of its natural enemy, {{TP|Lucy|Seviper}}. However, when Enta protected Zangoose from Seviper's {{m|Poison Tail}}, it calmed down and ended up winning the battle, earning Enta the Luck Symbol.
{{-}}

==Trivia==
* A girl inside the Battle Pike says, "I've completed the challenge 10 times now, but I've never had to battle a Trainer once." This information would be false, because after two straight wins and again at ten straight wins, she would have to battle Lucy. However, it should be noted that she did not state whether or not she beat the Battle Pike ten times ''in a row'', so this might not necessarily be an error.
* In the {{tc|Gentleman}}'s room, when his Pokémon attacks, if the player do not press any button, normally two text boxes will be activated, but if the player press the A or B button when the Pokémon approaches, a third text box will activate, ordering the Pokémon to stop. This occurs because when the player enter in the room, the Pokémon approaches so quickly that the game can no longer load all the text boxes in time.
{{Youtubevid|anFXW4_nzcY|channel/UCCheenv4-UJG9zDa_3kFBNw|name=LanceAndMissingNo.|Water|Electric}}
* If the player's Pokémon faints from {{status|poison}} before a Double Battle in the Battle Pike, the player can send out two Pokémon (the second one will be a clone of the first one). This also allows to have a glitched party screen like during [[Glitzer Popping]]. To do so, the player must do these steps:
*# Have the first Pokémon faint.
*# View the third Pokémon's status in the party.
*# Faint the second Pokémon due to poison.
*# Enter the Double Battle.
