'''Route 101''' (Japanese: '''{{tt|１０１番道路|１０１ばんどうろ}}''' ''Route 101'') is a route in southwestern [[Hoenn]], connecting [[Littleroot Town]] and [[Oldale Town]].

==In the games==
===Route description===
Route 101, the first route which Trainers from [[Littleroot Town]] traverse on, is home to a wide array of different Pokémon. Hence, Professor Birch often performs his studies here. Heading north from Littleroot, the route forms a "U", turning north and immediately backpedaling east near the first patch of grass. A ledge blocks the way north, letting only southbound travelers avoid the grass. Route 101 then turns north into another patch of grass as it heads west. At this point, the path travels through the last of three grass patches. Route 101 then turns north as it enters Oldale.

At the start of the game, the {{player}} meets [[Professor Birch]] as he is being attacked by a [[wild Pokémon]]. The player then battles the Pokémon with either a {{p|Treecko}}, {{p|Torchic}}, or {{p|Mudkip}}, found in {{i|Poké Ball}}s in the Professor's [[bag]]. Whichever of the three Pokémon that is chosen will become the player's [[starter Pokémon]].

In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, after battling with Brendan/May on {{rt|103|Hoenn}} and returning to the lab, the player will receive the [[DexNav]] application at the entrance to Route 101. Near Oldale Town, Brendan/May will explain the mechanics of hidden Pokémon, then a hidden Poochyena will appear. If the player succeeds in sneaking up to the Pokémon, the encounter will be a level 5 Poochyena that has an elemental fang attack as its first move; if the player scares it away, enters another battle, or leaves the area, the Poochyena will not reappear.

In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Professor Birch will give the player more starter Pokémon from other [[region]]s if the player has completed certain milestones. The following starter Pokémon are available:
* [[Johto]] starter Pokémon ({{p|Chikorita}}, {{p|Cyndaquil}}, and {{p|Totodile}}): after entering the [[Hall of Fame]] for the first time and meeting [[Zinnia]]
* [[Unova]] starter Pokémon ({{p|Snivy}}, {{p|Tepig}}, and {{p|Oshawott}}): after completing the [[Delta Episode]] (and after choosing a Johto starter)
* [[Sinnoh]] starter Pokémon ({{p|Turtwig}}, {{p|Chimchar}}, and {{p|Piplup}}): after entering the Hall of Fame for the second time (and after choosing a Unova starter)
If the above conditions are met, then the next time the player exits their house in Littleroot Town, Professor Birch will be heard yelling for help from Route 101. When the player arrives to help, they will be allowed to choose one of the starter Pokémon.

==In the anime==

Route 101 debuted in ''[[AG001|Get the Show on the Road!]]'', where {{an|May}} was shown [[bicycle|cycling]] towards [[Littleroot Town]]. {{Ash}} and May were later seen travelling along the route towards [[Oldale Town]] in ''[[AG002|A Ruin with a View]]''.

==In the manga==
[[File:Hoenn Route 101 Adventures.png|thumb|180px|Route 101 in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Route 101 debuted in ''[[PS182|Making Mirth with Mightyena]]''. {{adv|Ruby}} first encountered [[Professor Birch]] and his daughter {{adv|Sapphire}} on this route, saving the former from a pack of {{p|Mightyena}} and meeting the latter at her [[Secret Base]]. In this Secret Base, the two [[Pokédex holder]]s made a bet that required Ruby to earn all the {{pkmn|Contest}} [[Ribbon]]s and Sapphire to earn all the [[Gym]] [[Badge]]s of [[Hoenn]] within the next 80 days.

In ''[[PS267|It All Ends Now VIII]]'', Ruby and Sapphire reunited at Sapphire's Secret Base, having both succeeded in their respective goals within the time limit. Ruby had also taken time to [[Decoration|decorate]] the Secret Base before Sapphire's arrival.

==Trivia==
* In [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]], the first wild Pokémon encountered on this route is always a [[level]] 3 {{p|Wurmple}}, after taking three consecutive steps in the [[tall grass]].
* Route 101 is the shortest first route in any of the Pokémon games.
** However, it is not the shortest route during the player's first full visit to the route. The player is required to walk at least 35 steps to navigate the route, which is five more steps than [[Kalos Route 1]].
* Of all the first routes in the [[core series]] games, Route 101 is the only one to ever contain wild Pokémon while not containing any obtainable items.
