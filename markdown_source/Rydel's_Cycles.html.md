'''Rydel's Cycles''' (Japanese: '''サイクルショップカゼノ''' ''Cycle Shop {{tt|Kazeno|Rydel}}'') is a location in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s|Ruby, Sapphire}}, {{v2|Emerald}}, {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire}}. It is located in [[Mauville City]], east of the [[Pokémon Center]].

While appearing like a regular house, there are many bikes on a grassy area outside. The owner, [[Rydel]], will give the {{player}} a bicycle upon learning that they have traveled from [[Littleroot Town]] to Mauville on foot. This serves, as put by a non-player character later in the game, as advertising: the gift bicycle has Rydel's name written all over it.

The bicycle shop has no affiliation with [[Miracle Cycle|the bike shops]] of the [[Kanto]] and [[Johto]] regions. It is the only known bike shop in the [[Pokémon world]] to sell two different bicycles: the [[Acro Bike]] and the [[Mach Bike]]. While only one may be taken at once, Rydel is more than willing to exchange one bike for the other at any point in the game. This must be done to complete certain events and overcome certain obstacles, as each bike performs differently. Instruction manuals for each bike can be found on a pair of tables in the side room of the shop.

In [[Generation VI]], after the [[Delta Episode]], the player has the opportunity to carry both bikes at the same time. After advertising the bikes to certain NPCs, the player will receive the counterpart bike of the one they are currently using as thanks for their continued advertisement of the Rydel brand. The NPCs are located:

* {{rt|111|Hoenn}} [[Desert]]: A {{tc|Hex Maniac}} up a muddy slope to the north that requires the Mach Bike to climb.
* {{rt|119|Hoenn}}: A {{tc|Bird Keeper}} at the northmost maze of bridges, requires {{m|Surf}} and {{m|Waterfall}} along with the Acro Bike.
* [[Battle Resort]]: A biking {{tc|Triathlete}} southeast of the [[Pokémon Day Care]].

==Trivia==
* The Japanese motto is じゃりみち はしれば こころも はずむ.
* Advertisements for Rydel's bikes can be found in [[Rad Rickshaw's Cycle Shop]] in the [[Sinnoh]] region.
* "Rydel" might be a portmanteau of "ride" and "gravel" from the motto.
* According to a {{tc|Triathlete}} on [[Seaside Cycling Road|Cycling Road]], the name "Rydel" is printed all over his bicycles.
