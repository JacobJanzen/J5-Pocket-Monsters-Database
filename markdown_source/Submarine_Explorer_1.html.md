[[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|Ru}}{{sup/6|OR}} or [[Team Aqua]]{{sup/3|Sa}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}} twice try to steal the [[Devon Parts]], which are parts of the submarine, before the submarine can be built.

After the submarine is completed, Stern reveals that its purpose is to explore the [[Seafloor Cavern]], an [[underwater]] cavern on {{rt|128|Hoenn}}. However, [[Team Magma]]{{sup/3|Ru}}{{sup/6|OR}} or [[Team Aqua]]{{sup/3|Sa}}{{sup/3|E}}{{sup/6|AS}} end up stealing the finished product in [[Slateport City]] and taking it to the cavern themselves.

In [[Generation III]], the only time the submarine is visible is when it is parked in the entrance of the Seafloor Cavern while the villainous team is inside. In [[Generation VI]], the submarine gets more screentime, being showcased during the theft in Slateport, the preparations at [[Team Magma Hideout]]{{sup/6|OR}} or [[Team Aqua Hideout]]{{sup/6|AS}}, and parking inside the Seafloor Cavern. In these games, the submarine is also modified by the villainous team after it is stolen. It is modeled to look like a {{p|Camerupt}}{{sup/6|OR}} or {{p|Sharpedo}}{{sup/6|AS}}, each team's signature Pokémon, and is equipped with a special drill designed to break the seal blocking the entrance to the Seafloor Cavern.

Inside the Seafloor Cavern, one of the grunts remarks that the submarine is "brutal as a ride" because of its small size. Judging by the number of villainous team members in the Seafloor Cavern, the submarine is able to fit at least seven{{sup/3|E}} people. The submarine is not seen again after the player clears the villainous team from the Seafloor Cavern.

===Pokémon Generations===
The Submarine Explorer 1 first appeared in ''[[PG07|The Vision]]'', where it was seen at [[Team Magma Hideout]] in its modified state. [[Maxie]], [[Tabitha]], and a division of {{tc|Team Magma Grunt}}s boarded the submarine and headed for the [[Seafloor Cavern]].

The submarine reappeared, this time in its Alpha Sapphire guise, in ''[[PG08|The Cavern]]''. [[Team Aqua]] used it to exit the Seafloor Cavern after [[Archie]] had awakened [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] {{p|Kyogre}}. Once they surfaced, Archie was shocked to discover that the devastation Kyogre was causing was far beyond anything that he had planned for.

{{spoilers}}
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
The Submarine Explorer 1 (called '''S.S. Kaien 1''' in the [[Chuang Yi]] translation) first appeared in ''[[PS202|Slugging It Out With Slugma II]]'', where it was stolen by [[Team Magma]] in [[Slateport City]]. {{adv|Ruby}} was caught inside the submarine during the theft, but he managed to get away by using an onboard escape pod. With the submarine's [[Devon Parts|key component]] having been stolen from [[Mr. Stone]] by [[Team Aqua]] in ''[[PS189|Mowing Down Ludicolo]]'', the two teams agreed on a temporary truce in ''[[PS230|Walrein and Camerupt]]'' in order to combine their resources. When the key component was combined with the submarine, it became able to reach greater depths than usual, allowing both teams to safely reach the [[Seafloor Cavern]] together in ''[[PS233|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon I]]''.

In ''[[PS242|Very Vexing Volbeat]]'', [[Archie]] sent the submarine to dive to the ocean's depths on autopilot after trapping {{adv|Amber}} and [[Tabitha]] inside it and removing the key component. As a result, the submarine began to buckle under the high pressure of the deep sea, and was ultimately destroyed in ''[[PS243|No Armaldo Is an Island]]'', with wreckage floating to the surface while Amber and Tabitha were saved by [[Blaise]].

===={{chap|Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PAORAS13|Omega Alpha Adventure 13]]'', two submarines, each based on one of Submarine Explorer 1's [[Generation VI]] post-upgrade designs, appeared under the ownerships of Neo Team Aqua and Neo Team Magma, respectively. The [[Admin]]s of the teams used them to travel to [[Mossdeep City]].
