'''Sootopolis City''' (Japanese: '''{{j|ルネシティ}}''' ''Rune City'') is a city located to the east of the [[Hoenn]] mainland.

Sootopolis City plays a major part in the {{pkmn|games}}, as it is the location where the {{player}} has their encounter with the [[Legendary Pokémon]] {{p|Groudon}}{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}} or {{p|Kyogre}}{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/6|AS}}, and obtain their final [[Badge]].

Sootopolis City has a fantastic nighttime view, with stars peering in through the top of the crater.

In the games, Sootopolis City can only be reached by diving through {{rt|126|Hoenn}}, or by {{m|Fly}}ing or [[soaring in the sky|soaring]]. Sootopolis is surrounded by {{rt|126|Hoenn}}.

==Slogan==
'''''The mystical city where history slumbers.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|れきしが　ねむる　しんぴの　まち}}''' ''The mystical city where history slumbers.'')

==History==
Sootopolis City is located inside of a giant crater.

In {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}, the crater is that of an underwater volcano which erupted and forced itself out of the sea many years ago, eventually filling with rainwater, also known as a {{wp|caldera}}.

In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the crater was formed by a giant meteorite impact into the ocean of the Hoenn region a thousand years ago, eventually filling with rainwater. People soon began to dwell in the crater for its warm, fresh water and a city soon came forth. The great tree in front of the [[Cave of Origin]] was received from [[AZ]] when he visited from the [[Kalos]] region.

To navigate the city, people have to climb many flights of stairs and {{m|Dive}} under the sea. This causes many of the locals to get into good shape.

==Role==
===Delta Episode===
During the [[Delta Episode]], after {{Steven}} has informed [[Wallace]] of the plan to enter the [[Sky Pillar]], Wallace is outside the [[Cave of Origin]] talking to the guard about the great tree. He invites the player to follow him to the Sky Pillar's entrance on {{rt|131|Hoenn}}, then leaves.

==Places of interest==
===Cave of Origin===
{{main|Cave of Origin}}
The [[Cave of Origin]] is located in Sootopolis City. Inside, the player can meet either {{p|Groudon}}{{sup/3|R}}{{sup/6|OR}}, {{p|Kyogre}}{{sup/3|S}}{{sup/6|AS}}, or Wallace wondering about {{p|Rayquaza}}'s whereabouts{{sup/3|E}}.

===Competitive brothers===
In the house northeast of the Pokémon Center, there are two brothers who are arguing over two different species of Pokémon. The younger brother is a {{tc|Fisherman}}, while the older brother is a {{tc|Hiker}}. In Ruby, Sapphire, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire, the younger brother prefers {{p|Barboach}} and the older brother prefers {{p|Shroomish}}. In Emerald, the younger brother prefers {{p|Seedot}} and the older brother prefers {{p|Lotad}}.

In Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, the brothers are arguing over the sizes of their favorite Pokémon. If a brother is shown a Pokémon of the species he prefers, he will calculate its {{DL|Personality value|size}} and give the player an [[Elixir]] if it is larger than any he has seen before. The initial record size is the average height of the species being argued over, which is 0.4 meters in Ruby and Sapphire and 0.5 meters in Emerald.

In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the brothers are arguing over the cuteness of their favorite Pokémon. If a brother is shown a Pokémon of the species he prefers with an [[Affection]] of at least level 4, he will give the player a [[Max Elixir]]. Unlike the Generation III games, each brother will only give away an item once.

===Sootopolis Gym===
{{main|Sootopolis Gym}}
In Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire, [[Wallace]] is the [[Gym Leader]] in this city. He uses {{type|Water}} Pokémon, and is the one who hands out the {{badge|Rain}}.

In Pokémon Emerald, Wallace is the former Gym Leader, with his former mentor [[Juan]] resuming the role due to Wallace moving on to become {{pkmn|Champion}}.

===Move Tutor===
In {{game|Emerald}}, inside the Pokémon Center there is a trainer who will teach a compatible Pokémon {{m|Double-Edge}} one time only.

In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, in the northeastern part of Sootopolis City there is a house with an elderly gentleman within it. If the player talks to him with a {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon with high [[friendship]], he will offer to teach it {{m|Draco Meteor}}.

===Backdoor house===
In Pokémon Emerald, the house with a back door which hosts [[e-Reader]] battles is southeast of the Pokémon Center. Its original location in Mossdeep City in Ruby and Sapphire was superseded by a Game Corner.

==Demographics==
===Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire===
In {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, the population of Sootopolis City is 39. This is a middling population in [[Hoenn]], despite its near isolation from the rest of the region.

===Pokémon Emerald===
In Pokémon Emerald, the population of Sootopolis City is 43.

===Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire===
In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Sootopolis City has a total population of 42.

==In the anime==
[[File:Sootopolis City anime.png|thumb|left|250px|Sootopolis City in the anime]]
In the {{pkmn|anime}}, the volcano Sootopolis City is built upon opens up at one side, giving access to {{DL|Transportation in the Pokémon world|ships and boats}}. After leaving [[Izabe Island]], {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} arrived in Sootopolis City in ''[[AG110|The Great Eight Fate!]]''. Ash was planning to challenge the local [[Gym Leader]] to a {{pkmn|battle}} in order to obtain his eighth [[Gym]] [[Badge]], which would qualify him to compete in the [[Hoenn League]] {{pkmn|League Conference|Championships}}.

Upon arriving, {{an|May}}, [[Max]], and {{an|Brock}} saw fireworks and realized an event was being held in the city, so they ran to join the attendees. It was soon revealed that the Mayor of Sootopolis City was inaugurating a water-themed theater and that [[Juan]], the Leader of the [[Sootopolis Gym]], would put on a show with his {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} as part of the festivities. May was amazed at how beautifully Juan's Pokémon took the stage and Brock commented on how they had been well-raised. Throughout Juan's presentation, May was even more impressed and said Juan could be a great [[Pokémon Coordinator]].

[[File:Ash Rain Badge.png|thumb|220px|Ash holding the Rain Badge]]
{{TRT}} was also impressed by Juan and they decided to steal his Pokémon, but Juan managed to send them blasting off with minimum effort. After that, Ash approached Juan saying he would like to have a battle with him, and once Juan agreed, the group was taken to the Gym on a boat. While on their way to the Sootopolis Gym, the group discovered that Juan is a former winner of the [[Grand Festival]], having received the [[Ribbon Cup]] and the title of [[Top Coordinator]] years ago. They also learned why he [[Type expert|specializes]] in Water-type Pokémon.

When they got to the Gym, they were greeted by {{ho|Sebastian}}, Juan's butler and assistant, who explained to Ash the rules of the Sootopolis Gym. The Gym battle is divided into four rounds; the first is a [[Double Battle]] held in a large swimming pool with floating platforms and the other three are Single Battles conducted in a battlefield resembling a lake surrounded by land. Ash won the battle in ''[[AG111|Eight Ain't Enough!]]'', earning the {{Badge|Rain}}, his eighth [[Hoenn]] Badge overall, which allowed him to compete in the [[Ever Grande Conference]]. After that the group left for [[Pacifidlog Town]], site of an upcoming [[Pokémon Contest]] which May wanted to enter in order to obtain her fifth [[Ribbon]].

===Pokémon Adventures===
[[File:Sootopolis City ORAS Adventures.png|thumb|200px|Sootopolis City in the {{chap|Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire}}]]
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
Sootopolis City was first mentioned in ''[[PS192|Stick This in Your Craw, Crawdaunt I]]'', where [[Mr. Briney]] mentioned how his {{p|Whiscash}}, Whisko, had sensed multiple earthquakes happening in Sootopolis.

After [[Maxie]] awakened {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}} and {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}} at the [[Seafloor Cavern]], the two [[Legendary Pokémon]] confronted each other in Sootopolis City in ''[[PS250|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre &amp; Groudon XII]]'', where they began a fierce battle with each other. In order to prevent the immense energy resulted by the battle from going out of control, {{Steven}} and the [[Elite Four]] used the {{TP|Brandon|Legendary titans}}' {{m|Superpower}} to contain the energy in Sootopolis City. Due to the containment field created by the titans covering the city everywhere above it, the excess energy from the battle was forced downwards, causing the entire city to rise into the air. Eventually, the battle was stopped by {{adv|Ruby}} and {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Rayquaza}}, bringing the city back down to its proper place.

===={{chap|Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PAORAS19|Omega Alpha Adventure 19]]'', [[Zinnia]] was taken to Sootopolis after Rayquaza rejected her offer to join her in order to destroy the [[Grand Meteor Delta|meteoroid]] headed for Hoenn. Upon {{adv|Emerald}}'s request, Zinnia agreed to work alongside the Stones, [[Mr. Stone|Joseph]] and Steven, for a solution to avert the impending apocalypse. Eventually a plan was devised, which involved the Hoenn [[Gym Leader]]s, Elite Four, and [[Frontier Brain]]s, as well as the [[Draconid people|Draconids]], {{adv|Red}}, and {{adv|Green}}, all standing by at Sootopolis to launch a combined attack towards the meteoroid, while Ruby and {{adv|Sapphire}} would ride Rayquaza into space to strike the meteoroid directly with {{m|Dragon Ascent}}. The plan was executed successfully, saving the Hoenn region from yet another disaster, despite the unexpected emergence of a {{adv|Deoxys}} from within the meteoroid upon its destruction

==Trivia==
* [[Kiri]] was named after [[Junichi Masuda]]'s daughter, born right before the Japanese release of {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}.&lt;ref>[http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir/?p=96 Director's Column] (Japanese)&lt;/ref>
* In the flower patch next to the big tree [[AZ]] gave, there is a flower in the patch that is the same design as the flower on the Eternal Flower {{p|Floette}}, the Floette that befriended AZ in the {{g|X and Y}} storyline.
* This is the only city in the [[Pokémon world]] which requires the use of {{m|Dive}} in order to be reached for the first time.
* There is {{DL|List of glitches in Generation III|Sootopolis rock wall oversight|a minor collision error}} on one of the rocks in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}.
* In {{game|Emerald}}, the {{p|Seedot}} received from [[In-game trade|Kobe]] at [[Rustboro City]] is exactly 0.01 meters larger than the size requirement for the [[Elixir]].
* In {{game2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}}, the initial record holder's Trainer is named Marco. This is likely based on "{{wp|macro}}," a Greek prefix that means large.

===Origin===
Sootopolis City appears to be based on the {{wp|Greece|Greek}} {{wp|List of islands of Greece|island}} of {{wp|Santorini}}, also known as Thera.
