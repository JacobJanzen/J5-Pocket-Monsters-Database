'''Pacifidlog Town''' (Japanese: '''{{j|キナギタウン}}''' ''Kinagi Town'') is a town located in the seas south of the mainland of the [[Hoenn]] [[region]].

Pacifidlog Town is a small town built on wooden rafts and logs that float on top of a {{p|Corsola}} colony. The people living in Pacifidlog Town all [[Fishing|fish]] and {{m|dive}} as part of their lifestyle. The ancestors of the people in Pacifidlog Town were said to have been born on boats, and lived and died aboard them. According to legend, they lived that way because they were searching for something.

There is also a legend in Pacifidlog Town of a flying {{t|Dragon}} Pokémon that never needs to rest. This could refer to {{p|Rayquaza}}. There is also a [[Myths and legends involving Legendary Pokémon#Legend of the Regis|legend]] of three sealed-away Pokémon that represent the powers of {{t|Ice}}, {{t|Rock}}, and {{t|Steel}}, which refers to the [[Legendary titans]]: {{p|Regice}}, {{p|Regirock}}, and {{p|Registeel}}.

The town is located east of {{ci|Slateport}} and the [[Sealed Chamber]], and west of the [[Sky Pillar]].

In the [[Generation III]] games, the {{player}} cannot [[Running Shoes|run]] or ride a [[Bicycle]] in Pacifidlog Town.

==Slogan==
'''''Where the morning sun smiles upon the waters.''''' (Japanese: '''{{j|あさひが　みずべを　てらす　まち}}''' ''The town where the morning sun shines upon the waters.'')

==Places of interest==
===Mirage Island man===
In {{3v2|Ruby|Sapphire|Emerald}} an old man can be found living on the east side of Pacifidlog Town. He is seen looking out for {{gdis|Mirage Island|III}} and will shout out in excitement on days that it appears. Every day, the game generates a random number between 0 and 65535. If this number matches the [[personality value]] of any of the Pokémon in the {{player}}'s [[party]], Mirage Island will be accessible that day.

In {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}} the old man instead tells the {{player}} about [[Mirage spot]]s.

===Pokémon Fan Club Chairman's sibling===
The [[Pokémon Fan Club Chairman]]'s younger brother lives in a house on the west side of the town. He will give out one of two possible [[TM]]s every seven days depending on the [[friendship]] of the player's {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. If the first Pokémon in the party's friendship is high, he will give the player {{TM|27|Return}}; if it is low, he will give the player {{TM|21|Frustration}}. If the Pokémon's friendship is neutral, he will not give any TM, but the player may still receive a TM by showing him a different Pokémon.

===In-game trade===
Located south of the [[Pokémon Center]], there is a woman who will trade a {{p|Corsola}} for a {{p|Bellossom}} in Ruby, Sapphire, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire. In Emerald, a man will trade a {{p|Horsea}} for a {{p|Bagon}}.

===Move Tutor===
In {{game|Emerald}}, inside the Pokémon Center there is a tutor who will teach a compatible Pokémon {{m|Explosion}} one time only.

==Demographics==
===Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire===
In {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, Pacifidlog Town's population in the games is only 20, a low number by [[Hoenn]] standards. This may be attributable to its remote location.

===Pokémon Emerald===
In {{game|Emerald}}, Pacifidlog Town has a total population of 21.

===Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire===
In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Pacifidlog Town has a total population of 18.

==In the anime==
[[File:Pacifidlog Town anime.png|thumb|left|220px|Pacifidlog Town in the anime]]
In the {{pkmn|anime}}, Pacifidlog Town was shown to be located on a regular island known as Pacifidlog Island, instead of a town built on wooden rafts. Like many other towns in the [[Hoenn]] [[region]], it is home to a [[Contest Hall]].

The group was due to arrive in Pacifidlog in ''[[AG114|Date Expectations]]'', but due to engine troubles, their arrival was delayed, so they instead spent time on neighboring [[Donto Island]]. They resumed their trip to Pacifidlog after [[Carlos]] fixed the boat's motor.

{{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} officially arrived in Pacifidlog Town in ''[[AG115|Mean With Envy]]'', where they encountered local [[Pokémon Coordinator]]s [[Erica]] and {{OBP|Joshua|Coordinator}}. Erica, who was expecting to win the Pacifidlog {{pkmn|Contest}} together with her boyfriend Joshua, engaged in a [[rival]]ry with May after she saw her chatting with him. Later on, the three young Coordinators, as well as a [[List of Team Rocket's disguises|disguised]] [[Jessie]], entered the Pacifidlog Convention in hopes of getting the coveted Pacifidlog [[Ribbon]].

[[File:May Pacifidlog Ribbon.png|thumb|220px|May holding the Pacifidlog Ribbon]]
In the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]], Jessie had {{MTR}} using {{m|Fury Swipes}} to make a sculpture of {{an|Giovanni}} and himself out of a giant block of ice, impressing the crowd. Joshua showcased his {{p|Houndoom}}'s talents with a [[Contest combination|combination]] of {{m|Shadow Ball}} and {{m|Swift}}, whereas Erica displayed her {{p|Jynx}}'s psychic powers by combining {{m|Blizzard}} and {{m|Psychic}}. May also made use of Blizzard, having {{TP|May|Skitty}} using the [[move]] to freeze the {{m|Razor Leaf}} she got from {{m|Assist}} before {{m|Double Slap}}ping the leaves to shower the stage in sparkling crystal. The four contestants were able to impress the [[Contest Judge|judges]] and advance to the [[Contest Battle|Battle Round]], which took place in [[AG116|the following episode]].

The first match of the second round put Jessie against Erica. The battle ended rather quickly as Jessie was disqualified for cheating, giving Erica a free pass to the finals. The battle between May and Joshua, on the other hand, was a hard fought one. It ended with an explosion caused by the clash of May's Skitty's Blizzard and Joshua's Houndoom's {{m|Flamethrower}}. Having won this battle, May advanced to the final round, where she faced Erica. She initially had trouble dealing with Jynx's {{m|Psychic}} attack, but managed to win the match after Skitty's Assist became {{m|Fire Spin}} and knocked Jynx out. This victory gave May her fifth Contest Ribbon, allowing her to enter the [[Hoenn Grand Festival]].

==In the manga==
[[File:Pacifidlog Town Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Pacifidlog Town in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{chap|Ruby &amp; Sapphire}}====
In ''[[PS240|Talk About Timing, Treecko]]'', {{adv|Wally}} was revealed to have traveled to Pacifidlog Town to obtain a more effective cure for his health problems. He had been informed of the place by the old man, named (Japanese: '''ゲムじーさん''' ''Mr. Gemu''), who was searching for {{gdis|Mirage Island|III}}. After {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}} and {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}} were awakened and started creating natural disasters all across Hoenn, both Wally and the old man evacuated the unstable floating settlement using two lifeboats.

==Trivia==
* There is a possibility that Pacifidlog's concept was inspired by the [[Pokédex]] entry for {{p|Corsola}} in {{game3|Gold and Silver|Pokémon Silver|s}}, which states that, in a south sea nation, the people live in communities that are built on groups of these Pokémon.
* In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, when played in English, the old man in the southeastern house says "One does not simply walk into a [[Mirage spot]]." This is a reference to the line "One does not simply walk into Mordor," from the film ''{{wp|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring}}''.
* When spoken to, a boy in the northwestern house will ask "Where did you come from?" but provides a dialog box that only allows "Yes" or "No" as answers, triggering the following responses:
**''"Yes? Yes Town? I've never heard of a place like that."''
**''"No? That doesn't make any sense. You have to come from somewhere. Oh! Wait! You're not going to say you were born at the bottom of the sea?"''
:This is an inside joke among [[Game Freak]]'s development staff. The Japanese name of "Yes Town", ハイタウン (''Hai Town'' or ''High Town''), was the name of an apartment building where the staff would stay while they were working on {{game|Red and Green|s}}.&lt;ref>[https://twitter.com/PLDHnet/status/1184473258126528512 Twitter summary of Game Freak's 30th anniversary stream] (retrieved February 25, 2020)&lt;/ref>
