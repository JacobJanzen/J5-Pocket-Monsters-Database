[[File:Hoenn Altering Cave Map.png|thumb|Altering Cave in [[Hoenn]]]]
The '''Altering Cave''' (Japanese: '''へんげのどうくつ''' ''Altering Cave'') is a mysterious [[cave]] found in {{game3|FireRed and LeafGreen|Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen|s}}, and {{v2|Emerald}}. Only {{p|Zubat}} can be found in it, but it would have been possible for the Altering Cave's [[wild Pokémon]] to be altered by using [[Mystery Gift]] at a Wonder Spot hosted by [[Nintendo]], hence its name. Despite this, no country has ever held an event to make use of this feature.

==Location==
In {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, Altering Cave is found north of [[Six Island]] on [[Outcast Island]].

In {{game|Emerald}}, Altering Cave is found on {{rt|103|Hoenn}}, on the east bank of the inlet that passes through the center of the [[route]]. The entrance of the cave is only open after the {{player}} enters the [[Hall of Fame]].

==Pokémon==
All of the unreleased {{pkmn2|event}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} can be found in the extended area of the {{FB|Hoenn|Safari Zone}} in {{game|Emerald}}, except for {{p|Smeargle}}, which is found in [[Artisan Cave]] at the {{Gdis|Battle Frontier|III}}. In addition, their evolutionary lines are all available in {{g|Colosseum}} as [[Shadow Pokémon]].

==Trivia==
* Had the distribution been used, then encountering {{p|Shuckle}} in this area would have been the only way to obtain the [[Berry Juice]] in [[Generation III]]. Instead, the item is entirely {{DL|List of unobtainable items|Berry Juice|unobtainable}}.
